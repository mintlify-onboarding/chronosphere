You can send third-party events to Chronosphere, which display as change events
within Changes Explorer, and as change events on dashboards, traces, and services,

[filter change events](/investigate/querying/filter-events) when you're trying to
understand the root cause of an issue, and [overlay change events](/observe/enable-events)
to correlate those events with system and service anomalies in real time.

Chronosphere lets you receive change events from these products:
