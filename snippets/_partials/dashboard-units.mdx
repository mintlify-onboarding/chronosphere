

- **Unit**: Defines the unit used to render the Y-axis. This has the most significant
  effect when you enable Abbreviate. Defaults to `Decimal`.
  - **Decimal**: Base 10 values. Observability Platform renders a value of
    `1000000` as `1M`.
  - **Bytes**: As decimal multiple-byte units. Observability Platform renders a
    value of `1000000` as `1MB`.
  - **Time**: Determines the [unit of time](/overview/concepts/time-units)
    that Observability Platform uses to interpret a numeric value.
  - **Percent**: Interprets the value as a percentile, representing 0% to 100% in a
    range of either 0.0 to 1.0 (**Percent (0.0-1.0)**) or 0 and 100
    (**Percent (0-100)**).

    For example, Observability Platform renders a value of `1.0` in **Percent
    (0.0-1.0)** as `100%`, and in **Percent (0-100)** as `1%`.
- **Decimals**: Defines how many decimal places Observability Platform renders for
  values.
  **Default** renders decimal places only if necessary and rounds to the nearest
  value. Numeric values from `0` to `4` render the corresponding number of decimal
  places.
- **Abbreviate**: Toggles whether to abbreviate units on the Y-axis. For example, if
  enabled, Observability Platform renders a value of `100000000` as `100M`. You can
  toggle this setting only if you set the **Unit** to `Decimal` or `Bytes`; `Time`
  units `Time` units are always abbreviated and `Percent` values don't require the toggle.
  Defaults to `true`.
