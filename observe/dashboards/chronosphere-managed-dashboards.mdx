Chronosphere Observability Platform includes several dashboards to visualize
information about itself and its usage within your organization.

For example, Observability Platform dashboards let you pin tooltips and view nearby
series when holding the pointer over a tooltip.

To pin a tooltip, click while a tooltip is visible in a dashboard's panel. This
causes the tooltip to persist in place, rather than following the cursor as you
move it across the visualization or disappearing after you move the cursor out of
the panel.

To unpin a tooltip, click the tooltip again.

<Info>
Chronosphere-managed dashboards are read-only. You can't edit or delete these
dashboards. You can export a managed dashboard's code representation and import
it as a new dashboard that you can modify, but the imported copy won't receive any
updates that Chronosphere makes to the original managed dashboard.

## Ingest dashboards

Use the following dashboards to monitor metric ingestion and health in your
Observability Platform tenant.

### Chronosphere Health Check

The **Chronosphere Health Check** dashboard monitors the stability and efficiency of
telemetry data ingestion in your Observability Platform environment. This dashboard
includes the following panels for metrics, change events, logs, and traces:

- The **Uptime Percentages (30d)** panel depicts the trailing 30-day product uptime
  of ingest, query, and console services as a percentage, which provides a snapshot
  of the reliability of Observability Platform.
- The **Historical Uptime** panel depicts the product uptime averages over time over
  the past 30 days.

The following panels are also included for metrics data:

- The **Invalid Data Points Rejected** panel visualizes counts of data points that
  fail validation, with separate time series presented for each reason.
- The **Ingest Latency** panel depicts the latency from the moment a metric is
  scraped to the moment it's persisted, with lines for those latencies at notable
  percentiles. This data helps you understand the efficiency and speed of metric
  ingestion, and helps your organization identify and address potential bottlenecks
  by correlating ingestion changes latency spikes.

{/* Vale doesn't like ampersands, but there's one in the name of the dashboard. */}

### CloudWatch Metrics Ingestion & Health

The **CloudWatch Metrics Ingestion & Health** dashboard displays operational
information about the health of your CloudWatch Metrics Streams integration with
Observability Platform. Use this dashboard to ensure that
[CloudWatch metrics are streaming](/ingest/metrics-traces/aws-cloudwatch-metric-stream#check-the-cloudwatch-metrics-ingestion--health-dashboard)
to Observability Platform.

{/* vale on */}

### Collectors

The **Collectors** dashboard provides a high-level visualization of metrics and
resources used by Chronosphere Collector instances.

### OpenTelemetry Ingestion & Health

The **OpenTelemetry Ingestion & Health** dashboard provides details about how much
data [OpenTelemetry Collector](/ingest/metrics-traces/otel) instances are ingesting
and how many system resources they're using.

The **Chronosphere OTLP Ingestion** panel group visualizes data on ingested data points
by metric type, transformed data points ingested and rejected by Observability Platform,
and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) API response codes and latency.

The **OpenTelemetry Collector Health** panel group visualizes memory and CPU core usage,
and OpenTelemetry Collector instances by version number. When using [Traces](/control/sampling),
data on trace spans might also be available.

The **OpenTelemetry Collector Exporters** panel group visualizes the number of data points
and trace spans sent, and the failure rates for sending or enqueuing data points
and trace spans. Use these to identify usage and potential bottlenecks in exporters.

The **OpenTelemetry Collector Batch Processor** panel group visualizes the number
of data points or trace spans sent in batches, and the rate of batches being sent
because of hitting batch size triggers or timing out.

The **OpenTelemetry Collector Receivers** panel group visualizes the rates of data points,
trace spans, and log records that the OpenTelemetry Collector accepted and refused.

### Google Cloud Integration (GCP)

The **Google Cloud Integration** dashboard provides details about how much
[Google Cloud Platform](/ingest/metrics-traces/gcp) (GCP) data Observability Platform
is ingesting. This includes the **Top Metric Descriptors**, Google Cloud service
status, GCP Timeseries API usage against recommended quotas, and meta-information
about the ingested metrics.

### GCP Timeseries API Quota Usage Per Project

The Google Cloud time series quota usage dashboard shows how much of the API quota is
used by each Google Cloud project. Use the dashboard to identify projects for which
you might need to request an increase. This panel populates after
[configuring Google Cloud metrics](/ingest/metrics-traces/gcp).

## Query dashboards

Use the following dashboards to monitor queries, identify resource intensive alert or
recording groups, and visualize metrics created for traces.

### Query Accelerator

The **Query Accelerator** dashboard visualizes the relative performance of queries
that have been optimized by the Observability Platform
[Query Accelerator](/observe/dashboards#query-accelerator) to queries that have
not been optimized.

### Trace Metrics

The **Trace Metrics** dashboard visualizes
[metrics created for traces](/control/sampling/trace-metrics).

## Cardinality dashboards

Use the following dashboards to visualize cardinality produced by jobs in a given
namespace, and identify information you can use to help reduce cardinality in your
Observability Platform tenant.

### Persisted Cardinality Quotas

The **Persisted Cardinality Quotas** dashboard displays cardinality consumption
breakdown by individual metric pools and priority.
[Persisted cardinality](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#persisted-cardinality) is a cumulative
measure that calculates the sum of the unique time series of the persisted writes
that Observability Platform stores, seen over the last 2.5 hours only.

Use this dashboard to understand cardinality costs across specific teams, services,
and pools, and to help pinpoint specific sources of cardinality growth, such as a
particular pool or priority group. This dashboard includes the following panels,
which are backed by specific
[persisted cardinality metrics](/overview/concepts/dictionary#persisted-cardinality):

- **Total Consumption of License** displays the persisted cardinality consumed across
  all metric pools divided by your persisted license capacity, expressed as a
  percentage.
- **Total Consumption** displays the same data as **Total Consumption of License**,
  plotted on a line graph over the last week.
- **Total Dropped** displays the total metrics dropped during a penalty period if
  your organization exceeds 100% of its Persisted Cardinality Capacity Limit.
- **Consumption of Thresholds** displays the persisted cardinality consumed for each
  configured [pool threshold](/control/shaping/quotas/define-pools#pool-thresholds),
  and the pool the thresholds are assigned to. This information helps determine
  whether data is being dropped for crossing a defined threshold, rather than
  crossing a hard limit such as a
  [capacity limit](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#capacity-limits).

In addition to these metrics, you can configure
[metric pools](/control/shaping/quotas/manage-pools) and priorities to display
**Consumption by Pool** and **Consumption by Priority** panels in this dashboard.
This view use the same pools and priorities configured in your
[Matched Writes Quotas](#matched-writes-quotas) dashboard. If you didn't configure
that dashboard, the **Persisted Cardinality Quotas** dashboard displays persisted
cardinality consumption only.

To further identify sources of cardinality cost increases, the
**Persisted Cardinality Quotas** dashboard includes panel groups that display top
metrics and values for your most critical usage tags defined in the
[Usage Dashboard](#usage-dashboard). For each of your usage tags, the
**Persisted Cardinality Quotas** dashboard includes two panels:

- A time series chart that displays the top label values
- A bar chart with a percentage breakdown of those values in descending order.

Use this information to identify the top metrics and label values for your usage
statistics that are contributing to your persisted cardinality license, in addition
to the metrics for your predefined metrics pools.

To modify the usage tags that Observability Platform uses to generate the top metrics
and labels that display in the **Persisted Cardinality Quotas** dashboard, contact
[Chronosphere Support](/support).

### Cardinality Overview

The **Cardinality Overview** dashboard visualizes the cardinality produced by jobs
in a given namespace. Use this dashboard to understand what jobs are causing high
cardinality, and how the metrics in a job contribute to cardinality.

### Metric Growth

The **Metric Growth** dashboard helps you identify potential sources of metric growth
in your system by highlighting the following panels:

- The **Overview** panel group visualizes the top 10 metrics and labels by volume
  in data points per second (DPPS).
- The **Change Over Comparison Period Using Averages** panel group visualizes the
  metrics and labels with the highest rates of growth over a selected comparison
  period by DPPS, and the labels with the highest rates of growth in unique values.
- The **Drilldown** panel group visualizes additional data about metrics or labels
  selected in the dashboard's **drilldownMetric** and **drilldownLabel** template variables.
  Visualized data includes cardinality and DPPS growth over time.

Use this dashboard to understand when:

- A newly added high-cardinality metric or label appears with high DPPS. You can
  understand its impact by comparing it to an older time range.
- An existing metric or label with more unique values appears to have grown in DPPS,
  such as a histogram metric whose buckets greatly increased.

You can then use this information to [reduce cardinality](/control/shaping/reduce-cardinality).

## Licensing dashboards

Chronosphere provides dashboards to monitor data usage against your licensing quotas.
Use these dashboards to help identify usage trends across data types. You can then
proactively manage data usage to avoid exceeding your organization's licensing
limits.

For more information about the licensing terms used on these dashboards, and details
about how Chronosphere calculates these values, see
[Licensing concepts](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing).

In addition to these dashboards, Chronosphere provides a consolidated
[License Overview](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#license-overview) dashboard which
contains information about your current license usage and data retention periods.
Unlike other Chronosphere-managed dashboards, you can access this dashboard in the
navigation menu by clicking **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin**, and
then clicking **<Icon icon="scroll" /> License Overview**.

### Metrics Query Capacity Overview

The **Metrics Query Capacity Overview** dashboard visualizes query capacity
consumption for automated metric queries against the system capacity. Use this
dashboard to understand how much query capacity you have as part of your budget. The
dashboard includes queries from monitors, recording rules, and service accounts in
the reporting metrics.

See
[automated source query limits](/administer/limits-licensing/limits/query-limits#automated-source-query-limits)
for more information about the limits that this dashboard visualizes.

- The **Overview** panel group displays the total number of query selectors currently
  consumed and dropped versus the system limit, and the number of selectors by source
  type. Other panels in this group display the total data reads per second and
  the number of data reads by source type.
- The **Monitors** panel group displays monitors' query selector usage and data reads
  per second by time interval, and the top collections and slugs by selector usage
  and data reads per second.
- The **Recording Rules** panel group displays recording rules' query selector usage
  and data reads per second by time interval, and the top execution groups, slugs,
  and output metrics by selector usage and data reads per second.
- The **Service Accounts** panel group displays the top Universally Unique Identifiers
  (UUID) by selector usage and data reads per second.
- The **SLOs** panel group displays the slugs of top SLOs by selector usage and data reads per second.

### Logging License Consumption

The **Logging License Consumption** dashboard monitors your log data consumption
against your contract, and includes the consumption by volume over time, and the
consumption of each [partition](/control/consumption/partitions) and any defined
[budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting).

This dashboard includes panels for different threshold types, which you can use to
review cumulative consumption trends across various time windows and partitions to
understand what's driving growth.

#### Contract

The **Contract** panel group displays the percentage of persisted data and the total
volume of persisted data consumed against your contract, alongside the total volume
of data specified in your contract.

#### Consumption

The **Global Consumption** panel group includes bar charts that display the total
volume of log data consumed per day, per week, and to date from the inception of your
contract. Each bar chart breaks down the consumption by partition.

#### Volume Thresholds

The **Volume Thresholds** panel group includes the following panels:

- **Rolling 1 Hour Volume**: How many bytes were consumed by the
  global partition on a rolling one-hour window.
- **Rolling 3 Hour Volume**: How many bytes were consumed by the
  global partition on a rolling three-hour window.
- **Daily Cumulative Volume**: The number of cumulative bytes
  the global partition consumed per day. Resets to zero at `00:00:00` UTC every day.
- **Weekly Cumulative Volume**: The number of cumulative bytes
  the global partition consumed per week. Resets to zero at `00:00:00` UTC every
  Monday.
- **Monthly Cumulative Volume**: The number of cumulative bytes
  the global partition consumed per month. Resets to zero at `00:00:00` UTC
  on the first day of each month.

#### Instant Rate Thresholds

The **Instant Rate Thresholds** panel group includes the following panels:

{/* vale off */}
- The **Received vs Allowed Per Second** panel displays the number of bytes per
  second received in the selected partition versus the number of allowed bytes.
  Received bytes doesn't include bytes that a child partition dropped.
- The **Dropped By Budget Per Second** panel displays the number of bytes per second
  that an instant rate threshold in the selected partition's consumption budget
  dropped, or any of its child partition's consumption budgets.
- The **Received By Child Partition Per Second** panel displays the number of bytes
  per second that child partitions of the selected partition received. This value
  doesn't include bytes that any children of the main child partitions dropped.
- The **Received By Priority Per Second** panel displays the number of bytes per
  second the selected partition received, broken down by priority. This value doesn't
  include bytes that a child partition dropped.
{/* vale on */}

### Matched Writes Quotas

The **Matched Writes Quotas** dashboard lets you view consumption per pool against
allocations, matched writes versus the capacity limit, and drops by pool and
priority. If you exceed your matched writes quota, use this dashboard to help
understand which pools breached the set limits and are at risk of dropping data. For
each pool in a penalty state, you can view how much data is being dropped, separated
by low, medium, and high priority data.

In addition to the default panels, you can configure panels that include custom
allocations for your pools by using the `pool_name` attribute. These custom allocations
let you focus on important pools so you can quickly view consumption details across
your organization.

This dashboard includes a **Summary** panel group containing panels for the following
statistics:

- **Current Total Consumption** displays the current total consumption rate as a
  percentage, which is calculated as the total matched writes consumed divided by the
  license capacity.
- **Total Consumption** displays the consumption rate of matched writes versus your
  total capacity limit for matched writes.
- **Total Dropped** displays the total amount of dropped data, separated by low,
  medium, and high priority data.
- **Pool Quota Breakdown** displays the consumption rate in DPPS of matched write
  license by pool name.

This dashboard also includes panel groups for each of your defined metric pools. Each
panel group contains panels for the following statistics:

- **Current Consumption**: displays the current total consumption rate of the
  selected pool as a percentage, which is calculated as the total matched writes
  consumed divided by the license capacity.
- **Consumption**: displays the consumption rate of matched writes for the selected
  pool versus your total capacity limit for matched writes.
- **Consumption by Priority**: displays the matched writes consumed in DPPS by
  priority within the pool, separated by low, medium, and high priority data.
- **Dropped by Priority**: displays the matched writes dropped in DPPS by priority
  with in the pool, separated by low, medium, and high priority data.

See [matched writes](/overview/concepts/dictionary#matched-writes) in the metrics
dictionary for more information about the metrics that Observability Platform uses to
create the statistics displayed in this dashboard.

### Tracing licensing information

<Info>
This dashboard is deprecated. To view current consumption data for traces against
your license capacity, view the
[License Overview](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#license-overview).
</Info>

The **Tracing License Consumption** panels monitor your processed data and persisted
data against your account limits for a given time span, defaulting to the last seven
days.

The dashboard provides these consumption percentages for each limit:

- The **Processed License Limit** displays the percentage of processed tracing bytes
  against your license limit. This percentage includes all bytes of trace data sent
  to and processed by Chronosphere. To limit the amount of tracing data your
  organization sends to Chronosphere, use [head sampling](/control/sampling/head-sampling).
- The **Persisted License Limit** displays the percentage of your persisted trace
  bytes against your license limit. To limit the amount of tracing data your
  organization persists, use [tail sampling](/control/sampling/tail-sampling) or
  [trace behaviors](/control/sampling/behaviors) to apply a set of fine-grained rules
  after any head sampling decisions.
- The **Processed to Persisted Ratio** displays a decimal ratio of processed to
  persisted data against your license limit. Use this information to understand the
  relationship between your processed and persisted data consumption.

This dashboard also includes two line graphs that display your daily data consumption
breakdown and your cumulative data consumption breakdown. The daily data consumption
graph clears each day to accurately represent your consumption for that period. Use
these graphs to identify any spikes in data consumption to help identify where you
can reduce the amount of ingested or persisted tracing data.

### Events License Consumption

<Info>
This dashboard is deprecated. To view current consumption data for change events
against your license capacity, view the
[License Overview](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#license-overview).
</Info>

The **Events License Consumption** dashboard monitors your event data against both
capacity and license limits, defaulting to the last seven days.

The dashboard provides these consumption percentages for each limit:

- The **Persisted capacity limit** displays the number of events that can persist per
  minute in your tenant. This limit is enforced and can incur penalties if exceeded.
  In certain circumstances, this limit can exceed the license limit temporarily.
- The **Persisted license limit** displays the number of events that can persist per
  minute, as defined by your the license in your contract with Chronosphere.
- The **Latest consumption percentage** displays a decimal ratio of persisted data
  against your per-minute license limit for the selected time period. This value is
  calculated by dividing the persisted events per minute by the number of events that
  can persist per minute, defined by the license limit. Use this information to
  understand the relationship between your persisted data consumption and the defined
  license limit.

This dashboard also includes a line graph that displays your daily data consumption
of events per minute compared against your license and capacity limits. Use this
graph to identify any spikes in data consumption to help identify where you can
reduce the amount of persisted events data.

## Usage Dashboard

The **Usage Dashboard** provides a regular breakdown of ingested and persisted metrics
across your organization by `cluster`,  `environment`, `app_name`, and `service_name`.

Use this dashboard to identify what is contributing the most to your Observability Platform
usage, and to manage your overall usage.
