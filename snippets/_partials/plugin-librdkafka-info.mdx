
This plugin uses the [librdkafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka)
library. Certain configuration parameters available through the Telemetry
Pipeline UI are based on librdkafka settings. These parameters generally use the
`rdkafka.` prefix.

In addition to the parameters available through the Telemetry Pipeline UI, you can
customize any of the
[librdkafka configuration properties](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md)
by adding them to a pipeline configuration file. To do so, append the `rdkafka.`
prefix to the name of that property.

For example, to customize the `socket.keepalive.enable` property, add the
`rdkafka.socket.keepalive.enable` key to your configuration file.
