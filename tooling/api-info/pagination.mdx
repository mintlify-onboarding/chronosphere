All endpoints that list objects are *paginated*, which means the server can
potentially return only a subset, or page, of the requested objects, along with an
opaque page token the client can use to fetch the next page of objects. To request
the first page, provide an empty page token. If there are no more pages to request,
the server returns an empty page token.

If you use filter arguments, the client must pass the same filters on each page request
in a single iteration. If you use new filter arguments, restart pagination by requesting
the first page with the new filters.

## Example

This example demonstrates the process to iterate over every monitor:

1.  Request the first page by sending a plain request with no page token:

    ```shell
    curl -H "API-Token: ${CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN}" "https://${CHRONOSPHERE_DOMAIN}/api/v1/config/monitors"
    ```

    The server responds with:

    ```json
    {
      "page": {
        "next_token": "abc123"
      },
      "monitors": [
        {
          "slug": "my-monitor",
          "name": "My Monitor",
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

2.  The response has a non-empty `page.next_token` field, which means you must send
    another request with this page token to fetch the next page of monitors:

    ```shell
    curl -H "API-Token: ${CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN}" "https://${CHRONOSPHERE_DOMAIN}/api/v1/config/monitors?page.token=abc123"
    ```

    The server responds with:

    ```json
    {
      "page": {
        "next_token": "def456"
      },
      "monitors": [
        {
          "slug": "my-other-monitor",
          "name": "My Other Monitor",
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

3.  Because the non-empty `page.next_token` response field indicates there are more
    results to fetch, request the next page:

    ```shell
    curl -H "API-Token: ${CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN}" "https://${CHRONOSPHERE_DOMAIN}/api/v1/config/monitors?page.token=def456"
    ```

    The server responds with:

    ```json
    {
      "page": {},
      "monitors": [
        {
          "slug": "yet-another-monitor",
          "name": "Yet Another Monitor",
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

4.  When you get a response with an empty `page.next_token` field, you have reached
    the final page of results.
