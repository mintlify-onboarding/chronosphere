The [Services](/observe/services) page provides efficient views into your services to
help you discover ways of exploring your data. You can link directly to tracing data
related to a specific service from the **Services** page. Chronosphere Observability
Platform automatically generates these links to help you monitor services and
connected telemetry.

<Info>
The number of listed services in Trace Explorer might not match services listed in
the [service list](/observe/services#understand-the-services-table) due to
[service discovery jobs and merge rule configuration](/administer/service-discovery).

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<ServiceNavIcon /> System Overview <span aria-label="and then">></span> Services**.

1. In the list of services, your **Deployer Service** has a currently alerting
   monitor that exceeds the defined critical conditions.

1. Select the **Deployer Service** to display its individual service page.

1. In dependency map, in the **Trends** dropdown, select **Errors**.

   You notice that the edge for this service has downstream errors. From here, you
   can investigate trace data in Trace Explorer.

1. Click the outgoing edge for the **Deployer Service** to display a panel with
   statistics about this edge.

1. In the panel containing edge information, next to **Requests**, click the
   <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> more icon to display these options:

   When you select one of these options, Observability Platform applies the context
   defined in the service page:

   - **View in Trace Explorer** opens Trace Explorer with the selected service
     context. You can further refine the query to identify issues.
   - **Differential Diagnosis** opens the **Differential Diagnosis** tab in a drawer
     with the selected service. Use this information to
     [identify trends](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/traces) and immediately
     scan through all related tags and values to pinpoint the exact `tag:value` pairs
     most closely correlated with suspicious behavior.

1. Select **Trace Explorer** to open Trace Explorer.

1. In the **Trace Explorer** page, in the **Span statistics** section, select **Leaf Errors**
   in the **Metric** dropdown menu to highlight services that include error spans
   with no failing child spans.

   These errors are the deepest errors within a request flow, and are often the
   reason why an entire trace fails.

1. In the sparklines chart, you notice spikes in errors for the `gatewayauth`
   service.

1. In the **Metric** dropdown, select **Leaf errors** to focus on the root cause of
   the issues.

1. In the **Group by** field, enter **Operation** so that you're grouping results by
   both Service and Operation.

   In the **Span statistics** table, you see that the `auth.Auth/Authenticate` operation
   of the `gatewayauth` has the most leaf errors.

1. Click the **gatewayauth** service to add it and the `auth.Auth/Authenticate`
   operation to your search filter.

1. At the top of the page, click <Icon icon="link" /> **Copy link** to copy a link
   with the defined filter criteria that you can share with team owning that owns the
   `gatewayauth` service.

You identified the service and operation with the most leaf errors and can send a
contextual link to the team responsible for that service. By focusing on leaf errors,
you located the root issue impacting related traces and can provide that context to
the owning team.
