Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, from the creators of Fluent Bit and Calyptia, lets you control your observability data’s journey from collection to processing to routing.

</Tip>

Telemetry Pipeline deploys on your infrastructure to streamline the way you process logs, metrics, events, traces, and security data.

* Run Telemetry Pipeline in a [Kubernetes cluster](/pipeline-install/install-operator/kubernetes-cluster) or any [Linux](/pipeline-install/install-operator/linux) environment, including virtual machines.
* Automate pipeline management through [resource profiles](/pipeline-configure/resource-profiles), [autoscaling](/pipeline-configure/scaling), and [rollback](/pipeline-configure/history-rollback).

You can make decisions about how to collect, aggregate, and format your telemetry data, and then discard any data you don’t need.

* Use [parsers](/pipeline-data/parsers) to add structure to unstructured data.
* Build [processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) using a library of predefined, configurable actions, or write your own [custom Lua scripts](/pipeline-data/processing-rules/custom-lua).

Pipelines let you connect any source with any destination to send your telemetry data wherever you need it to go.

* Work with out-of-the-box [plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins) for popular [sources](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins) and [destinations](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins).
* Take advantage of open standards, like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry.

Fleets let you manage a large number of Core Agent and [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual) deployments under a single, unified configuration file.

* Gather logs from a variety of sources by [adding agents to a fleet](/fleets/add-agent-to-fleet).
* [Add files](/fleets/add-files-to-fleet) to make them available to all agents in a fleet.
