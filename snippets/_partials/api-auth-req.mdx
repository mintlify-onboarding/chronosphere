
Because the Chronosphere API requires authentication, include an API token with your
`curl` request, as shown in the following example. For more details, see
[Create an API token](/tooling/api-info#create-an-api-token).

```shell /"TOKEN"/ /INSTANCE/ /METHOD/ /ENDPOINT_PATH/
export CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN="TOKEN"
export CHRONOSPHERE_DOMAIN="INSTANCE.chronosphere.io"

curl -H "API-Token: ${CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN}" \
     -X METHOD "https://${CHRONOSPHERE_DOMAIN}/ENDPOINT_PATH"
```

Replace the following:

- _`TOKEN`_: Your API token.
- _`INSTANCE`_: The subdomain name for your organization's Observability Platform instance.
- _`METHOD`_: The HTTP method to use with the request, such as `GET` or `POST`.
- _`ENDPOINT_PATH`_: The specific endpoint you want to access.
