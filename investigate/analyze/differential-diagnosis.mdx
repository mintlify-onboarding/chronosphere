When troubleshooting issues, finding the root cause of a problem as quickly as
possible is critical. Chronosphere Observability Platform includes
_differential diagnosis_ (DDx) to help developers find the source of slowdowns or
failures by identifying suspicious trends in your telemetry data and what's causing
them.

Differential diagnosis lets developers resolve service performance issues without
writing queries or needing knowledge of the entire system. Differential diagnosis
ranks and highlights the most probable sources of issues so developers can test
hypotheses and compare trends to identify root causes.

## Identify issues in traces

In Trace Explorer or from service pages, use
[differential diagnosis for trace](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/traces) to
identify trends and immediately scan through all related tags and values to pinpoint
the exact `tag:value` pairs most closely correlated with suspicious behavior.

## Identify trends in metrics

In Metrics Explorer or from service pages, use
[differential diagnosis for metrics](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/metrics)
to examine time series anomalies, such as unusual shapes in their metrics like
spikes and dips, and quickly understand what dimensions are contributing to an issue.
