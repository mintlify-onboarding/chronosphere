Chronosphere offers an Early Access (EA) program, which gives select customers the
opportunity to preview and influence upcoming features before they reach General
Availability (GA). Your participation is essential in helping Chronosphere build
exceptional products.

## Program benefits

The EA program offers the following benefits:

- **First access to new features**: Try out new capabilities weeks or months before
  GA release, allowing your teams to experiment with new features, plan
  implementations, and train users.
- **Influence product direction**: Your feedback directly shapes feature design and
  capabilities. EA participants work closely with Chronosphere product teams to ensure
  features make observability easier and more intuitive, and integrate seamlessly into
  your workflows.
- **Strategic partnership**: Gain visibility into the Chronosphere product roadmap
  and build stronger relationships with product and engineering teams through
  dedicated feedback channels.

## Considerations

EA features are under active development. Changes will occur without advanced
notification, and can range from cosmetic updates to modifications that require
significant workflow changes. This iterative approach lets Chronosphere rapidly
incorporate customer feedback and refine features before GA.

<Warning>
Maintenance and support for EA features operate differently than GA features.
Although Chronosphere makes a best effort to quick address major bugs or issues
during the EA period, EA features aren't subject to the 99.9% uptime obligation
promised in the SLA for GA features.
</Warning>


To protect your operations, Chronosphere won't release any features to the EA program
that involve billing changes or have potential data quality impacts. These features
undergo additional validation and are available only in GA.
