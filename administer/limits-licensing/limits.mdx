Chronosphere sets immutable system limits to protect the system from failing in case
of a catastrophic event. These limits are like a circuit breaker that trips to
protect the system in the event of an abnormality in your data traffic patterns, such
as sudden, unexpected spikes in data ingestion.

Learn more about limits and protections for the following data types:

- [Events](/administer/limits-licensing/limits/event-limits)
- [Traces](/administer/limits-licensing/limits/trace-limits)
- [Metrics](/administer/limits-licensing/limits/metric-limits)
- [Queries](/administer/limits-licensing/limits/query-limits)

## Stay below capacity limits

Chronosphere enforces [license capacity limits](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#capacity-limits)
for all of your telemetry data. Exceeding these limits can put your organization at
the risk of dropping data. The type of data that's dropped depends on the limit
exceeded, such as metric quotas.

Exceeding your organization's license capacity limits can cause you to hit the defined
system limits, which shouldn't occur under normal operating circumstances. To prevent
your system from reaching system limits, use the following tools and information to
ensure that your Observability Platform tenant remains below your license capacity
limit at all times:

- Use the [License overview](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing) to track your
  telemetry usage against your licensing quotas.
- Review the
  [cardinality dashboards](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards#cardinality-dashboards)
  to identify information you can use to help reduce cardinality.
- Query [key metrics](/overview/concepts/dictionary#capacity-limits) to understand
  if Observability Platform is actively dropping data.
- Use the provided tools and techniques to
  [avoid hitting persisted cardinality limits](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#avoid-persisted-cardinality-limits).
