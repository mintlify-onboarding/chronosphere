<Info>
Pinned scopes aren't available for all pages. Users can't create pinned scopes at
this time, but you can [configure a scope](/administer/pinned-scopes). Contact
[Chronosphere Support](/support) to have scopes created for you.
</Info>

Pinned scopes define a set of consistent criteria for users to select a subset of
data. After configuration, pinned scopes appear on several pages in
Chronosphere Observability Platform.

## Filter using a pinned scope

Click the **Pin scope** box in a supported page to display the configured filters.
Click any filter to select it.

A pinned scope can exclude all data from a page, or sections of a page. For monitors
on a service page, if no monitors match the selected filter, Observability Platform
displays all monitors instead.

You can use pinned scopes to group [signals](/investigate/alerts/notifications/signals)
inside a [monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors) in a service, to reduce alerts.

## Modify a pinned scope in a query

When you activate a pinned scope on a page with user-generated queries, the
[chip](/navigate#chips) for the pinned scope displays with the query.

Click the pinned scope to activate or deactivate it.

To view the scoped query, click the <Icon icon="telescope" /> telescope icon.
A dialog box displays both the current pinned scopes modifying the query and the full
scoped query. Click **Copy scoped query** to copy the full query to your clipboard.

For example, if you're using the pinned scope `environment:production`, and query
for `chronocollector_build_information`, the dialog would display a message similar to:

```text
This query is being modified by the currently pinned scope

environment: production
The scoped query is:

chronocollector_build_information{environment=~"(|production)"}
```

You can copy the full query if necessary, and modify it.

### Scope conflicts

Queries with a conflict display with a yellow dot on the
<Icon icon="telescope" /> telescope icon. A conflict occurs if the queries
have a label matcher that matches a pinned scope. When a scope conflict occurs, your
query might retrieve less data than expected.

To correct a conflict:

1. View the query.
1. Click the conflicting matcher. Conflicting matchers use a
   <Icon icon="octagon-exclamation" /> warning icon and are highlighted.
1. The **Resolve conflict** window lists the conflicting matchers, and lets you
   correct conflicts by taking one of the following actions:
   - **Remove conflicting matchers:** Recommended. This field prepopulates with the
     conflicting matchers. Leave as is, or delete a chip to remove some matchers. The
     label matchers list updates based on the matchers to be removed.
   - **Disable pinned scope:** Disable the pinned scope **for this query** or
     **for the page**.
1. Click **Confirm** to continue or **Do nothing** to return to the previous page.
