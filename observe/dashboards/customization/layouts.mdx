Each [dashboard](/observe/dashboards) uses _panel groups_ to create a _layout_. Panel
groups consist of one or more _[panels](/observe/dashboards/panels)_ that visualize
the results of a query. Use Chronosphere to define your dashboard layouts and create
efficient visualizations of query results.

<Info>
[Classic dashboards](/observe/dashboards/classic-dashboards) have their own panel
  groups and methods of configuring them. For details, see
  [Classic dashboards](/observe/dashboards/classic-dashboards).

## Add a panel group to a dashboard

If you [add a panel](/observe/dashboards/panels#add-panels-to-a-dashboard) to a dashboard
that doesn't have any panel groups, Chronosphere creates a group for you. You can
also manually create panel groups for greater control.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="add-a-panel-group-to-a-dashboard-cloud">

To add a panel group to a standard dashboard:

1. Open the dashboard. You can
   [view a list of all dashboards](/observe/dashboards#view-dashboards) or select
   from a [list of dashboards in a collection](/administer/collections/home).
1. Click **<Icon icon="pencil" alt="Edit icon"/> Edit** on the
   dashboard.
1. Click **<Icon icon="square-plus" alt="Panel Group icon"/> Panel Group**.
1. In the **Add panel group** window, enter a **Name**.
1. Optional: Click the **Collapse state** dropdown and select whether the new
   panel group should be **Open** or **Closed** by default.
1. Click **Add** to add the new panel group.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add a panel to a panel group

To add a new panel to a panel group:

1. In the panel group to which you want to add a panel, click the
   **<Icon icon="chart-simple-plus" alt="Add panel to group icon"/> Add panel to group**
   icon.
1. In the **Add Panel** interface that appears, provide a name for the new panel.
1. Click **Add** to add the panel or **Cancel** to discard it.

Panels aren't permanently added to a panel group until you save all changes to the
dashboard by clicking **Save** on the dashboard.

For details about all of the settings in a panel, see
[Edit a panel](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel). You can save a new panel to
a dashboard with as little as a name, then edit it later to configure it and add or
modify queries.

## Move a panel within a panel group

To change a panel's position within a panel group, drag the panel by its
**<Icon icon="grip-vertical" alt="Move handle"/> Move handle** to the new
position.

## Move a panel to another panel group

To move a panel located in another panel group on the same dashboard:

1. [Edit the panel](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel) that you want to move.
1. Click **Group**.
1. Click the panel group that you want to contain the panel.
1. Click **Apply**.

Panels aren't permanently moved until you save all changes to the dashboard by clicking
**Save** on the dashboard.

## Modify a panel group

You can expand or collapse each panel group by clicking the
<Icon icon="chevron-right" alt="Expand icon"/> or
<Icon icon="chevron-down" alt="Collapse icon"/> icons, respectively, to toggle
the panel group's state. When collapsed, panel groups report the number of panels
inside the group.

To edit a panel group's properties:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="pencil" alt="Edit icon"/> Edit group** icon
   inside of the panel group that you want to edit.
1. In the **Edit panel group** window, set the group's **Name** and **Collapse state**.
1. Click **Apply** to apply the changes to the panel group.
1. Optional: To permanently save all changes to the dashboard, click **Save**.

To change a panel group's order within the layout:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="arrow-down" alt="Move group down icon"/> Move group down icon**
   to move the selected group down in the layout.
1. Click the **<Icon icon="arrow-up" alt="Move group up icon"/> Move group up icon**
   to move the selected group up in the layout.

Changes to a panel group aren't made permanent until you save all changes to the
dashboard by clicking **Save** on the dashboard.

## Delete a panel group

<Warning>
Deleting a panel group deletes **all panels** within the group. You can't undo
the panel group deletion without canceling all other changes made to the dashboard.
After you save changes to the dashboard that delete a panel group, you can't recover
its deleted panels.
</Warning>

To delete a panel group:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete group icon"/> Delete group icon**.
1. Read the **Delete panel group** confirmation request.
1. Click **Delete** to confirm that you want to delete the group and all panels
   within it.

Panel groups aren't permanently deleted until you save all changes to the dashboard
by clicking **Save** on the dashboard.

## Split a panel group with a dashboard variable

You can define a panel group as a _split panel group_ that dynamically splits and
replicates itself to display the panels it contains with each value of a
[dashboard variable](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables) applied
to them. This automates the creation of panel groups that automatically apply that
variable's value to each of the contained panels.

To use a split panel group:

1. [Add a panel group to a dashboard](#add-a-panel-group-to-a-dashboard) and
   [add at least one panel to the group](#add-a-panel-to-a-panel-group).
1. Define at least one dashboard variable and use it in the queries of panels in
   this panel group.
1. [Modify the panel group](#modify-a-panel-group).
1. Click the **Split Panel Group** toggle to enable it.
1. Enter or select the **variable name** of the dashboard variable that splits the
   panel group.
1. Click **Apply**.

The panel group splits into multiple groups for each value of the selected dashboard
variable. The variable and its value appear next to the panel group's name.

You can edit the original panel from any instance of it in any split panel group.
To modify the panel group, you must click the
**<Icon icon="pencil" alt="Edit icon"/> Edit group** icon inside of
the original panel group.
