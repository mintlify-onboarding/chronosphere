When [viewing all monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors#view-available-monitors),
you can select an individual monitor to view its details and take actions for that
monitor.

After selecting an individual monitor, you can view all details for that monitor and
[filter query results](#filter-query-results) to individual time series and related
change events. You can also
[view a monitor's history of changes](/investigate/alerts/monitors#version-history),
or its [alert history](/investigate/alerts/monitors#alert-history) to understand when
alerts triggered and which notifications were sent.

## Mute a monitor

If a monitor has any active [muting rules](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules),
Chronosphere indicates the number of active muting rules and when they expire.
Chronosphere displays a banner indicating **Alerts for this monitor are being muted**
if a monitor is actively muted or was muted within the last hour. The banner doesn't
display if there aren't active alerts, even if a muting rule is active.

To mute the selected monitor, a signal from a monitor, or any stored time series,
click **<Icon icon="bell-slash" /> Mute** to add a muting rule. When you create a
muting rule from a monitor, the muting rule's **Name** field prepopulates with the
monitor's name.

## Create a change event

You can create a change event directly from the details page for a specific monitor:

1. On the monitor details page, click **+ Create Event**.
1. Follow the instructions to
   [create a change event](/observe/enable-events/use-events#create-change-events).

## Investigate patterns

To investigate suspicious patterns, click
[**DDx**](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/metrics) to open metrics
differential diagnosis.

## Explore the query

To examine and modify the query and the metric the monitor uses, click
**Open in Explorer** to open the query in the [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer).

## More actions

Display additional monitor details by clicking the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />
three vertical docs icon for the selected monitor:

- [**Monitor Specifications**](/investigate/alerts/monitors/data-model) includes
  details such as the data source, slug, and time interval for the monitor.
- [**Conditions**](/investigate/alerts/monitors/data-model#conditions) are tests that
  the results of a monitor query are evaluated against, with a related severity.
- [**Notification Policies**](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies) contain
  rules for notifications, which send to specified endpoints (such as PagerDuty,
  email, and Slack) when an alert triggers, and optionally when the alert resolves.
- [**Edit Monitor**](/investigate/alerts/monitors#edit-a-monitor) opens a panel with
  tools for editing a monitor's configuration and notification policy, labels, query,
  signals, conditions, and annotations.
- [**Duplicate monitor**](#duplicate-a-monitor) duplicates the selected monitor.
- [**Version history**](/investigate/alerts/monitors#version-history) displays the
  history of changes to the selected monitor.
- [**Manage connections**](#connect-monitors-to-services-or-collections) adds links
  to related services and collections.

### Duplicate a monitor

Sometimes, you want to reuse a monitor with minor changes. Rather than recreating a
monitor and manually configuring each setting, duplicate the monitor, make the
necessary changes, and save the new monitor.

**Duplicate Monitor** copies the current monitor in a new panel, where you can
duplicate the monitor, make changes, and save it as a new monitor.

To duplicate a selected monitor:

1. Click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots icon.
1. Click **Duplicate monitor**.
1. In the **Duplicate monitor** pane,
   [edit the monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors#edit-a-monitor).

### View version history

**Version history** opens the history of changes for the monitor. To view the
history of changes for a selected monitor, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />
three vertical dots icon.

<VersionHistory />

### Connect monitors to services or collections

Services and collections can
[own monitors](/observe/services/service-pages#own-dashboards-and-monitors), but you
can also connect a monitor to any service or collection.

**Manage Connections** opens a panel where you can manage connections between the
selected monitor and any service or collection.

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerts <span aria-label="and then">></span> Monitors**.
1. Click the name of the monitor you want to edit.
1. To the right of the monitor's name, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />
   three vertical dots icon and select **Manage connections**.
1. Add or remove [a connection](/observe/services/service-pages#connected-resources).

## Filter query results

When viewing an individual monitor, you can filter the results plotted on the graph.
To display the query for the monitor, click the **Show Query** toggle.

1. Change the displayed error state by clicking either **All**, **All Alerting**, or
   **Critical Only**.

1. From the **<Icon icon="clock" /> [time range selector](/navigate/time-ranges)**,
   change the time range of the query results to modify the displayed time period.

1. In the **Series Legend**, select one or more series in the list to filter the
   resulting time series that the graph displays. See
   [Series legend](/investigate/alerts/monitors#series-legend) for more information.

1. Use the **Change Events** dropdown menu or advanced filtering syntax to
   [display change events](#display-change-events) related to the selected monitor.

    You can [create a change event](#create-a-change-event) such as a broadcast to
    inform other users of an upcoming outage, or a third-party change event in
    addition to the predefined change event categories.

1. Click the **Alert History** tab to display a history of alerts generated by the
   monitor.

### Display change events

Use the **Change Events** dropdown menu or advanced filtering options to display
change events on the **Query Results** panel for a monitor. Use
[basic filtering](#basic-filtering) to select a predefined query that displays change
events, or use [advanced filtering](#advanced-filtering) to define a query if you
know details about the change event you're searching for.

Change events use
[category icons](/observe/enable-events/use-events#categorize-change-events-intentionally)
for ease of visibility into different event types.

#### Basic filtering

From the **Change Events** dropdown menu, select one of the following predefined
queries to display change events:

- Broadcasts
- Broadcasts, deploy events in production, and feature flag updates in production
- Broadcasts, deploy events in production, feature flag updates in production, and
  alerts for the selected monitor
- All events

Click any change event icon in the graph on the **Query Results** panel to open a
more detailed view of change events for the selected time period. This list includes
the event time, category, and title for each change event. Click any change event to
view detailed information for a specific change event. When viewing this list, you
can also click **View in Changes Explorer** to open the selected filter in Changes
Explorer.

To learn more about change event details, refer to
[change event details](/observe/enable-events/use-events#change-event-details).

#### Advanced filtering

If you know some of the criteria to search for, you can use advanced filtering to
define a filter that displays specific change events. Use the lightweight
[filtering syntax](/investigate/querying/filter-events#filtering-syntax)
to define which change events you want to display for the selected monitor.

The filtering syntax supports the following keys:

- `category`: Event category, such as `alerts`, `broadcasts`, or `deploys`.
- `labels`: Label metadata you've annotated your change events with, such as `build`,
  `environment`, or `description`.
- `source`: Event source, such as `alert_history`, `buildkite`, or `deployer`.
- `title`: Event title, either partial or complete.
- `type`: Event type, such as `build_started`, `deploy_start`, or `monitor_muted`.

To use advanced filtering:

1. Click **Filter Events** to display the filter box.
1. Define a filter based on the change event attributes you want to filter on.

For example, the following filter returns all `infrastructure` change events where
the build completed on the `master` branch:

```text
category = "infrastructure" AND type = "build_finished" AND labels.build.branch = "master"
```

<Info>
Filters can span multiple lines, and you can use `AND` plus `OR` operators to
include or exclude parameters in your query.
</Info>

1. Click **Filter**, or press `Shift+Enter` (`Shift+Return` on
   macOS) to run the query.
1. In the query result histogram, click any change event icon to view more
   information about each change event.
1. When viewing change event details, click a change event from the list to view more
   detailed information.

    To learn more about change event details, refer to
    [change event details](/observe/enable-events/use-events#change-event-details).
