title: Overlay and enable change events
description: Overlay and enable change events in Observability Platform to understand what changed in your environment.

When investigating issues, on-call engineers can enable and overlay _change events_ on
[dashboards](/observe/enable-events/dashboards),
[traces](/observe/enable-events/traces), and
[services](/observe/enable-events/services). This additional context helps correlate
events with system and service anomalies in real-time, allowing for quicker
identification of incident cause.

[Change events](/overview/concepts/change-events) can also display in the
**Query Results** for individual monitors. When on-call engineers click links in
Observability Platform notifications, they're directed to the **Monitors** page for
the related alert. On-call engineers can
[display change events for a monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors/monitor-actions#display-change-events)
using predefined filter configurations, or define queries using advanced filtering to
display the events they want to visualize. This capability helps to determine issues
before the alert triggered, such as code deploy and audit log events.

On-call engineers can also [create change events](/observe/enable-events/use-events)
from Chronosphere Observability Platform or with the Chronosphere API. This feature
lets on-call engineers create relevant change events, such as a broadcast to inform
other users of upcoming maintenance, or create third-party change events in addition
to the predefined change event categories.

<Info>
To overlay change events, your organization must purchase
[change event tracking](https://chronosphere.io/platform/change-event-tracking/)
and have it enabled in your tenant.
