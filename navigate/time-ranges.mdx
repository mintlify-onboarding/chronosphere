Many features in Chronosphere Observability Platform share a common interface and
methods for selecting a _time range_. Tools such as [monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors),
[dashboards](/observe/dashboards), [service pages](/observe/services/service-pages),
and [explorers](/investigate) use time ranges to segment or scope queries, charts,
tables, and graphs.

In these tools, the **<Icon icon="clock" /> time range selector** displays
the defined time range and provides multiple methods to select a new time range.

- Click the time range selector as a dropdown menu to select a range relative to
  the current time from a list of predefined options, such as **Last 30 minutes**.
- Click the time range selector as a dropdown menu and click **Custom date range**
  to interactively select a time and date range using a calendar.
- Click the time range selector as a text field and enter a custom relative range,
  such as `Last 2 weeks`, `2 weeks`, or `2w`.
- Click the time range selector as a text field and enter a custom absolute time
  and date range using a `MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM/PM` format.

Some time range selectors also provide additional controls to shift, expand, refresh,
or pin the selected time range.

## Use the time range selector

The time range selector provides options for defining a date and time range. The selector
also displays the currently applied time range, including the abbreviated time zone
applied to the range.

### Select a predefined relative time range

To select a predefined time range:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="clock" /> time range selector** as a dropdown
   menu.
1. Select a time range in the list.

### Select a custom time and date range

To interactively select a custom time and date range from a calendar:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="clock" /> time range selector** as a dropdown
   menu.
1. Select **Custom time range**.
1. Navigate to the month of the start date. To go forward or backward one month
   at a time, click
   **<Icon icon="chevron-left" alt="Previous month icon"/> Previous month**
   and **<Icon icon="chevron-right" alt="Next month icon"/> Next month**.

1. Optional: Instead of using the calendar, you can also click the **From** and
   **To** date fields and enter the date, using the format `MM/DD/YYYY`.
1. Click the **From** and **To** time fields to select the time range's starting
   and ending times.
1. Optional: Instead of using the dropdown selector, you can click the time
   fields and enter the times, using the format `HH:MM:SS` followed by `AM` or `PM`.
1. Optional: You can set the **To** fields to the current date and time by clicking
   **Set to now**.
1. Click **Apply** to confirm the set time range, or **Cancel** to discard it.

### Enter a custom relative time range

To enter a custom relative time range:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="clock" /> time range selector** as a text
   field.
1. Enter a custom relative time range using Observability Platform's
   [time units](/overview/concepts/time-units).

   The time range selector accepts any of these formats, where `1` in the quantity
   and `week` and `w` represent the time unit:

   - `Last 1 week`
   - `1 week`
   - `1w`

You can enter any integer quantity greater than zero. Relative ranges support only
millisecond and larger time units, and convert units smaller than a second to decimal
values of a second.

<Warning>
The time range selector doesn't support entering decimal values of time units,
even if it sometimes displays them.
</Warning>

### Enter a custom absolute time range

To enter a custom absolute time range:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="clock" /> Time range selector** as a text
   field.
1. Enter a custom absolute time range using a `MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM/PM` format,
   separated by a dash (`-`).

Absolute times apply your account's [configured time zone](/navigate#your-account),
which is displayed as an abbreviation in the time range selector.

For example, the value `01/01/2025 09:00:00 AM - 01/05/2025 09:00:00 PM` selects
a range from January 1, 2025, at 9:00 AM (09:00) to January 5, 2025 at 9:00 PM
(21:00) in your account's configured time zone.

### Shift a time range

To shift the defined time range forward or backward in time while retaining the
same duration, click the **<Icon icon="chevron-left" /> previous** and
**<Icon icon="chevron-right" /> next time range** buttons.

Shifting a relative time range also converts it to an absolute time range.

### Expand a time range

To expand the defined time range's duration while retaining the same point in time
at the range's center, click the **<Icon icon="magnifying-glass-minus" /> zoom out**
button.

Expanding a relative time range also converts it to an absolute time range.

On data visualization tools, there is no control to shrink, or "zoom in," for a time
range. Instead, click and drag within a panel visualization to select a time range.

### Refresh a time range

To manually refresh the current point in time for a relative time range, or to update
a visualization's contents within an absolute time range, click the time range selector's
**<Icon icon="rotate" /> Refresh** button.

On dashboards, you can also configure a default automatic refresh interval. For
details, see [Manage dashboard time ranges](/observe/dashboards/customization/time-ranges).

### Pin a time range

You can **pin a time range** to specify a default range for a time range selector. When you
return to a feature where you've pinned time range, that feature applies the pinned
range as the new default.

To pin a time range:

1. In the time range dropdown, click the
   **<Icon icon="thumbtack" alt="Pin time range"/> pin time range** icon.
1. If a relative time range is selected, select whether to pin the relative time
   range, or an absolute custom time range of the same duration that ends at the
   current time.

To unpin a time range, click the
**<Icon icon="thumbtack" alt="Unpin time range"/> Unpin time range** icon in the
time range dropdown.
