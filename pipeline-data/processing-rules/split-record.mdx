The split record [processing rule](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) splits an array
of JSON objects into a series of standalone records.

## Configuration parameters

<Params />

| Name                                  | Key | Description | Default |
| ------------------------------------- | --- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Source key**                        | `key` | Required. The key that contains the array to split. | _none_ |
| **Preserve non-array data** checkbox  | `skipMissing` | If selected, the split record rule preserves instances of **Source key** that contain non-array data. If unselected, this rule removes instances of **Source key** that contain non-array data. | Not selected |
| **Preserve empty arrays** checkbox    | `skipEmpty` | If selected, this rule preserves instances of **Source key** that contain an empty array. If unselected, this rule removes instances of **Source key** that contain an empty array. | Not selected |
| **Preserve original array** checkbox  | `keepOrig` | If selected, this rule includes the full body of the original array inside each split object. If no **Destination key** is set or if **Destination key** is the same as **Source key**, the original array won't be preserved. | Not selected |
| **Destination key**                   | `dest` | The key to store the resulting split object. If unspecified, each split object is stored in a key with the same name as **Source key**. | _none_ |
| **Comment**                           | `comment` | A custom note or description of the rule's function. This text is displayed next to the rule's name in the **Actions** list in the processing rules interface. | _none_ |

## Example

Using the split record processing rule lets you restructure your telemetry data
by turning a combined array of events into multiple standalone events. For example,
given these sample logs:

```json
{"events":[
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","user_id":4,"page_id":10,"action":"purchase"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"click"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","user_id":5,"page_id":40,"action":"purchase"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","user_id":1,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z","user_id":2,"page_id":40,"action":"click"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"click"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z","user_id":1,"page_id":20,"action":"view"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","user_id":2,"page_id":50,"action":"purchase"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z","user_id":2,"page_id":10,"action":"view"},
  {"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"view"}
]}
```

A processing rule with the **Source key** value `events` and the **Destination key**
value `log` returns the following result:

```json
{"log":{"action":"purchase","user_id":3,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","page_id":30}}
{"log":{"action":"purchase","user_id":4,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","page_id":10}}
{"log":{"action":"click","user_id":1,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z","page_id":50}}
{"log":{"action":"purchase","user_id":5,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","page_id":40}}
{"log":{"action":"purchase","user_id":1,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","page_id":30}}
{"log":{"action":"click","user_id":2,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z","page_id":40}}
{"log":{"action":"click","user_id":3,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z","page_id":30}}
{"log":{"action":"view","user_id":1,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z","page_id":20}}
{"log":{"action":"purchase","user_id":2,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","page_id":50}}
{"log":{"action":"view","user_id":2,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z","page_id":10}}
{"log":{"action":"view","user_id":1,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z","page_id":50}}
```

This rule assigned each object in the original `events` array to a series of keys
named `log`.
