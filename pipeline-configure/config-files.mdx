title: Pipeline configuration files
description: Use configuration files to customize your pipelines.
---
{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


In Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline, the settings for each pipeline are stored
inside a dedicated configuration file. These files must follow a standard
[format](#format), but you can customize their contents to control how your
pipeline gathers, modifies, and sends data.

<Info>
Due to Kubernetes [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)
storage limitations, the total size of a pipeline and its associated resources
can't exceed 1&nbsp;MiB. This limit includes the combined size of configuration files,
[secrets](/pipeline-configure/secrets), [parsers](/pipeline-data/parsers),
and [any other files](/pipeline-configure/files).
</Info>

## Modify a pipeline's configuration file

Use one of these methods to modify a pipeline's configuration file.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web interface" id="ui">

When you modify a pipeline by using the Telemetry Pipeline web interface, that
pipeline's configuration file updates to reflect your changes, even if you didn't
edit the file directly.

You can also edit configuration files directly in the **Advanced Settings**
section of the pipeline builder, either by pasting raw YAML into the text field
or by using **Import** to select a YAML file from your device. If the configuration
settings you specify are valid, the pipeline builder continuously saves any changes
you make and updates your pipeline accordingly.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="cli">

In [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli), run the following command:

```shell /NAME/ /FILE/
calyptia update pipeline NAME --config-file FILE
```

Replace the following values:

- _`NAME`_: The name of the pipeline whose configuration file you want to update.
- _`FILE`_: The new configuration file to use for that pipeline. This must be a
  `.yaml` file.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Format

Configuration files follow standard YAML conventions and use the `.yaml` file
extension. Regardless of a pipeline's individual settings, all configuration
files adhere to the same core format:

```yaml filename="my-pipeline.yaml"
pipeline:
  inputs:
    - Name: source1
      setting: value
      setting: value
      processors:
        <...>
    - Name: source2
      setting: value
      setting: value
      setting: value
      setting: value
      processors:
        <...>
  outputs:
    - Name: destination1
      setting: value
      processors:
        <...>
    - Name: destination2
      setting: value
      setting: value
      setting: value
      processors:
        <...>
```

<Info>
Configuration files use two spaces per indent, not four.

## Sections

All configuration files include a `pipeline` section, an `inputs` section, and
an `outputs` section. Additionally, each input or output can contain an associated
`processors` section.

### Pipeline

The `pipeline` section is the top-level section in a configuration file. It's a
parent to the `inputs` section and the `outputs` section.

### Inputs

The `inputs` section is a sequence of mappings that contains one or more sources
of telemetry data. Each mapping corresponds to a single
[source plugin](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins), and includes
key/value pairs to configure the settings for that plugin, plus an optional
`processors` object.

### Outputs

The `outputs` section is a sequence of mappings that contains one or more destinations
for your telemetry data. Each mapping corresponds to a single
[destination plugin](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins), and includes
key/value pairs to configure the settings for that plugin, plus an optional
`processors` object.

### Processors

Each `processors` section is a child to one of the mappings within the `inputs`
section or `outputs` section. These sections contain
[processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) to modify the
telemetry data passing through each input or output.

Because processing rules run separately for different types of telemetry data,
a `processors` section is grouped into subsections for `logs`, `metrics`, and
`traces`, where applicable. Each telemetry type subsection includes an
`actions` object, which is a sequence of mappings that contains one or more
processing rules and each rule's associated settings.

<Info>
If an input or output doesn't have processing rules associated with a particular
type of telemetry data, the subsection for that telemetry type is omitted.
</Info>

These sections adhere to the following format:

```yaml filename="my-pipeline.yaml"
pipeline:
<...>
      processors:
        logs:
          - name: calyptia
            actions:
              - type: rule1
                opts:
                  setting: value
                  setting: value
                  setting: value
              - type: rule2
                opts:
                  setting: value
                  setting: value
        metrics:
        - name: calyptia
            actions:
              - type: rule1
                opts:
                  setting: value
                  setting: value
              - type: rule2
                opts:
                  setting: value
        traces:
        - name: calyptia
            actions:
              - type: rule1
                opts:
                  setting: value
                  setting: value
              - type: rule2
                opts:
                  setting: value
                  setting: value
                  setting: value
```
