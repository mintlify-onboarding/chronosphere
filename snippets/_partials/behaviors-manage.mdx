
- Assign a _main behavior_ to define the primary behavior for a dataset.
- Assign an _override behavior_ to temporarily override the main behavior.

  <Note>
  You can assign only one main behavior and one override behavior to a dataset.
  </Note>

Both the main and override layers can use any of the
[trace behavior types](/control/sampling/behaviors#trace-behavior-types), which are
baseline, allow, and deny. You can also
[create custom behaviors](/control/sampling/behaviors#create-custom-behaviors) and
assign them to the main or override layers on datasets. When assigning a behavior to
the override layer, you can set the behavior to start immediately, or schedule it to
start at a future time.

When managing assigned behaviors, you can set the shaping order for overlapping trace
datasets. The shaping order determines the priority order to apply behaviors when
traces in one dataset overlap with traces in another dataset. For example, if a trace
belongs to more than one dataset with an assigned behavior, Observability Platform
uses the behavior assigned to the dataset that's first in the shaping order.

The shaping order applies only when the selected behavior is active.
