A _distribution_ chart takes a query result and visualizes the counts of data points
bucketed by values.

## Distribution chart queries

Distribution charts use one or more PromQL
[queries](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-query) to retrieve data to
visualize.

Use the following **Option** to modify your query:

<DashboardDownsampleTruncate />

## Configure a distribution chart

You can configure a distribution chart by
[modifying its **Settings**](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).

Any changes you make in the panel's Settings tab are immediately displayed in the
**Preview** pane, but take effect only when you both click **Apply** in the **Edit panel**
interface and then click **Save**.

Observability Platform doesn't fully support directly editing a panel's JSON
representation. Chronosphere recommends you configure panels by using the user
interface. Use the JSON representation only for managing your configuration as code
with tools such as [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) and
[Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform).

### Modify a distribution chart's units and formatting

The **Unit and formatting** section in a table's **Settings** tab defines how the
chart interprets and displays the panel's query units.

<DashboardUnits />

### Modify a distribution chart's percentile markers

The **Percentile markers** section in a table's **Settings** tab defines how the
chart displays percentiles. Select one or more checkboxes to display the following
percentiles on the graph:

- `P50`
- `P75`
- `P90`
- `P95`
- `P99`
