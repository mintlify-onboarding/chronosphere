The Chronosphere Observability Platform user interface guides you to the resources
you need.

## Personal home page

After you sign in, Observability Platform displays your personal
[home page](/observe/personal-homepage).
You can [customize](/observe/personal-homepage#customize-your-home-page) this
home page to display the information you need the most.

To return to the home page from anywhere in Observability Platform, click the
Chronosphere icon at the top of the navigation menu.

## Team and collection home pages

Teams and collections have their own _home pages_ populated with links to associated
resources, and also customizable links and descriptions. For details, see
[Team and collection home pages](/administer/collections/home).

## Search

Observability Platform provides a global search bar on every page that supports
searching for teams, collections, dashboards, monitors, services, and SLOs by name.
To search, click the search bar or use the keyboard shortcut `Control+K`
(`Command+K` on macOS) to focus on the bar, and then begin typing. Search
results will appear as you type.

By default, search results include all supported resource types. To toggle a resource
type's visibility in the results, click its selector at the top of the results list.

The icons in the resource type filters correspond to the icons displayed next to
each result and identify each result's type. Resources in the results that belong
to a team or collection also list them beneath the result's name.

## Header navigation

[Dashboards](/observe/dashboards), [service pages](/observe/services/service-pages),
and [SLOs](/observe/slo) in Observability Platform have a header that displays
[team ownership](/administer/accounts-teams/teams) and the
[collection or service that owns](/observe/dashboards#create-a-dashboard) the displayed
resource. The header also enables searching for other resources owned by the same
team or collection.

1. In the navigation menu, select either **Dashboards**, **Services**, or **SLOs**.
1. Click a dashboard, service, or SLO from the table.
1. Click the dashboard or service name to display the header overview.

You can click the team, service, or collection name to go to its overview page.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Many pages in Observability Platform include keyboard shortcuts. Press
`Control+/` (`Command+/` on macOS) to display the shortcuts for a
page. Not all pages include shortcuts.

## Mobile-friendly pages

Some pages in Observability Platform have been optimized for use on cell phones and
other mobile devices. Mobile-friendly pages include Monitors, Dashboards, Services,
SLOs, Collections, and Teams.

## Chips

Observability Platform uses [chips](https://m2.material.io/components/chips)
in the web app. Chips are generally used as filters to narrow down the scope of
searches or queries. [Pinned scopes](/navigate/pinned-scopes) and
[search](#search) are two examples of pages using chips.

![Chips in a pinned scope](/public/doc-assets/chip-pinned-scope.png)

If a chip has a <Icon icon="xmark" /> close icon, you can click the icon to
remove the chip. Chips without a close icon are pinned scopes that can be deactivated
or reactivated by clicking the chip.
