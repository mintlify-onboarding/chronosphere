It's critical to understand your services' performance and reliability to ensure
those services are meeting your business's needs. To do so, you can define and
communicate your expectations for a service's performance.

In many cases, it's sufficient to define [monitors](/investigate/alerts) that measure
metrics about a service against a fixed threshold, and to alert those responsible
for the service when that threshold is exceeded. However, in complex and dynamic
systems monitors can also be falsely triggered by inconsistent data or fail to
alert on gradual issues that build up over time.

_Service level objectives_ (SLOs) instead focus on longer-term performance reporting and
changes in error rates. In an SLO, you define these elements:

- A percentile _objective_ that represents your goal for uptime or error-free operation.
  For example, your objective for a service might be to maintain 99.95% uptime.
- An _error budget_, or your tolerance for downtime or errors. This is the inverse
  of your objective, because it represents the service capacity that can be lost before
  the service fails its objective. Likewise, changes to your objective also change
  your error budget. For example, a 99.95% uptime objective also defines a 0.05%
  error budget.
- Metrics queries that define _indicators_ of your performance against that objective.
  For example, you might query for the summed duration of error responses that your
  service returned to requests, and compare that to the total time the service was
  running. This creates an _error ratio_, or the percentage of errors against your
  total.
- A _time window_ that you'll measure for performance against your objective. Your
  SLO measures your error or success rates against the total over the time window,
  such as the last four weeks, to determine whether the service met the objective.

Chronosphere Observability Platform lets you create SLOs you can use to define
objectives, set queries, and measure and visualize performance over a time window.
Chronosphere SLOs use a rolling time window to report the ongoing status of a service,
as opposed to calendar time windows that are fixed to specific dates.

After you've defined your SLO, it then identifies your error or success rate against
the total over the time window. If the service met your objective in the time window,
the SLO reports the service is healthy. If not, the SLO reports its objective was
breached and visualizes the state of metrics before the breach for investigation.

For a high-level overview of planning and designing SLOs, see
[Design service level objectives](/observe/slo/design). For instructions on how
to create, update, and delete an SLO, see [Manage service level objectives](/observe/slo/manage).

## Differences from monitors

Although SLOs seem similar to monitors, SLOs provide a more dynamic incident
detection method that let you trigger alerts based on changes in real user
experiences, rather than at an arbitrary threshold.

SLOs also provide additional details for more granular notifications:

- SLOs report the _burn rate_ of your error budget, which you can configure to raise
  alerts when the service is depleting its error budget over a short period within your
  time window. Burn rate alerts can help you respond to sudden degradations of
  performance before they breach your SLO, and burn rate visualizations can identify
  patterns in error rates that might not be as evident when looking only at the
  service's metrics.

  For example, a burn rate alert can trigger notifications if more than 2% of your
  error budget is consumed over a one-hour span. You can then respond closer to
  the beginning of the incident and attempt to prevent the SLO from breaching by
  investigating the problem and finding a solution. Such a spike in burn rate will
  also be displayed on the SLO's burn rate chart, which can help you pinpoint when
  the service degradation started.
- You can define label-based _dimensions_ to break down your SLO's measurement by
  time series. This helps you respond to complex services represented by multiple
  time series by letting you signal for specific series that breach the SLO.
- You can perform [differential diagnosis](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/metrics) (DDx)
  on your SLO's charts to begin correlating concerning patterns in error rates.

## SLO terminology

Service performance is generally defined in these ways:

- Service level agreements (SLA): Contracts between a provider and a client that
  determine acceptable performance measurements, and the consequences for violating
  those measurements. An SLA defines the limits and consequences for failures.
- Service level objectives (SLO): Usually internal targets for specific metrics
  that the provider aims to meet. These should be as specific as possible and are
  usually stricter than the SLA. For example, to ensure you meet an SLA to maintain
  99.95% uptime or respond to an incident in less than two hours, you might define
  your SLO as meeting a standard of 99.999% uptime or responding to an incident
  within 60 minutes.
- Service level indicators (SLI): The measurement being evaluated in an SLO
  or SLA, often as service uptime, availability, or response success rate. For example,
  if a SLO is to maintain 99.999% service uptime, the SLI is the service's uptime
  metric.

For more information about industry-standard SLO terminology, see the
[Google SRE handbook](https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/) and
[Design service level objectives](/observe/slo/design).

## View overall SLO status

You can view a list of SLOs to identify if any are breaching their limits. You can
also filter the list to narrow your view to specific keywords, team, or owner.

To view a list of existing SLOs:

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin**.
1. Select **<ServiceNavIcon /> System Overview <span aria-label="and then">></span> SLOs**.

To filter the SLO list, use one of these methods:

- Enter text into the **Search SLOs** search field to filter by name
- Use the **Select an owner** dropdown to filter by the SLO's owning collection
  or service
- Use the **Select a team** dropdown to filter by the SLO's assigned team.

The SLO table contains the following information:

- **Status**: The SLO's health, summarized as a status icon. An SLO's health is
  defined by the alerting status of its monitor or the state of the series measured
  by the SLO as compared to its error budget.

  | Icon | Description |
  | ---- | ------------|
  | <Icon icon="hexagon-exclamation" style={{ color: 'rgb(238, 108, 108)' }}/> | Has at least one series with an error rate that exceeds the defined critical conditions. |
  | <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" style={{ color: 'rgb(255, 178, 73)' }}/> |  Has at least one series with an error rate that exceeds the defined warning conditions. |
  | <Icon icon="circle-check" style={{ color: 'rgb(89, 204, 141)' }}/> | No series are alerting. |
  | <Icon icon="bell-slash" style={{ color: 'rgb(165, 130, 237)' }}/> | Alerting is muted. |
  | <Icon icon="bell-slash" /> | Alerting is disabled. |
  | <Icon icon="circle-xmark" /> | No data is available. |

- **Name**: The SLO's name.
- **Objective**: The objective defined for this SLO.
- **Alerting Enabled**: Whether or not alerting is enabled for this SLO.
- **Owner**: The service or collection that owns this SLO.
- **Team**: The team responsible for the **Owner**.
- **Source**: This SLO's creation method.

  <InfoTerraformLockout />

The row for each SLO in the list also includes a
<Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots icon that provides quick access
to SLO creation, editing, and deletion. Click the icon to select one of the following
options:

- **Duplicate**: Click to open the SLO [create](/observe/slo/manage) drawer, populated
  with the information used to create the existing SLO. Configure the new SLO and then
  click **Save** to create the new SLO.
- **Edit**: Click to update your SLO using the [create](/observe/slo/manage) drawer.
- **Delete**: [Delete](/observe/slo/manage) the SLO.

## View an SLO

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="view-an-slo-web">

Click the name of any SLO in the list to open its page, which is similar to a dashboard
and visualizes important metrics related to one or more services.

### SLO menu

An SLO page's menu provides access to features that modify the SLO's behavior:

- **Events**: Click to open the **Display events** drawer. Select the checkboxes for
  the events you want to display, and then click **Save**.
- **Mute**: Click to [create a muting rule](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules#create-a-muting-rule)
  for this SLO. If a muting rule is already active for an SLO, a banner indicates
  the active muting rule and its expiration.

The menu also includes a link to the <Icon icon="book-open" /> documentation
and a <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots icon.

Click the three vertical dots to select one of the following options:

- **Duplicate**: Click to open the SLO [create](/observe/slo/manage) drawer, populated
  with the information used to create the existing SLO. Configure the new SLO and then
  click **Save** to create the new SLO.
- **Edit**: Click to update your SLO using the [create](/observe/slo/manage) drawer.
- **Version history**: Review previous versions of this SLO's configuration.

  <VersionHistory />

The menu's [time range selector](/navigate/time-ranges) displays the current time range
applied to the SLO's visualizations and lets you define a new time range. You can
also select the SLO's time range by clicking and dragging across the time span you
want to define in any of the SLO's visualization charts.

### SLO details

The **SLO details** section provides a high-level view of the SLO's overall health,
and indicates whether your SLO is meeting its objective or has breached its target.

- **Alerting status**: The [SLO's status](#view-overall-slo-status).
- **Availability target**: The SLO's currently defined objective.
- **[Reporting status](#reporting-status)**: If the SLO is firing alerts, or if
  its error budgets are depleted or low, Observability Platform displays
  additional indicators to summarize these major issues.

The following charts visualize performance against the SLO's defined limits:

- **Availability**: Availability results based on the SLI's rate definition.
- **Error budget**: The SLO's remaining error budget over its defined time window.

As with all charts on the SLO view, hovering over it reveals
<Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots. When clicked, this provides
options to open the chart's query in Metrics Explorer, add the chart to a dashboard,
or investigate it using Metrics DDx. See
[common panel elements](/observe/dashboards/panels#common-panel-elements) for an
explanation of the available tools.

#### Reporting status

If an SLO is breached or close to being breached, the SLO page displays a
**Reporting status** that's otherwise hidden from view. This status contains chips
for the SLO's firing alerts, depleted error budgets, and error budgets that are close
to depletion.

If the reporting status is visible for an SLO, you should immediately begin
investigating the causes for the statuses it reports.

#### SLO alerting

If a low-error-rate SLO alert fires, the alert can continue to fire for up to the
configured long window for hours after the resolution of the issue that caused the
alert. The time of alert firing depends on the rate of decrease in the error budget.

#### Series

Use the **Series** subsection's table to search for or select specific series to
view in the **Availability** and **Error budget** charts. Each row represents a
time series returned in the SLI's query.

The table has the following columns:

- **Status**: The [SLO status](#view-overall-slo-status) for that series.
- Columns for labels and values: Each column's header is the name of a label in
  that series, and its cells contain that label's value for that row's series.
- **Actual**: The metric's value over the SLO's defined time window.
- **Error budget**: The SLO's remaining error budget for that series. If the cell's
  background is red, its value represents a breach of the SLO.

### SLI breakdown

The **SLI breakdown** section consists of charts that visualize your service level indicators,
which are based on the SLO's definition. For more information, see
[Create service level objectives](/observe/slo/manage).

These charts include:

- **Total requests**: A visualization of the SLI's [total query](/observe/slo/manage),
  representing the total requests to the service.
- **Errors**: A visualization of the SLI's [error query](/observe/slo/manage).

### Burn and error rates

The **Burn/Error rates** section consists of charts that visualize the error budget
burn rate and the rate of reported errors. Burn rate calculations are based on the
SLO's definition. For more details, see [Create service level objectives](/observe/slo/manage).

You can adjust the **window** used for visualizations, which can be `1h`, `6h`,
`1d`, or `3d`.

### Change events

<LimitedAvail />

<Info>
[Change events](/observe/enable-events/use-events) are required for SLO history.
</Info>

If this service uses [change events](/observe/enable-events/use-events), those
events are graphed in this section. This includes events generated by this SLO and
also events added by other features to connected services.

### SLO information

The **SLO information** section provides a user-defined **Description** of the SLO
and relevant **Runbook** links, as defined in the [create](/observe/slo/manage) drawer.

**Related queries** depend on features enabled in your tenant. In addition, the SLO
must be owned by a service, not a collection. When clicked, the links open in a new
tab and populate the page with a query based on the selected SLO. These links include
the following:

- **View traces**: When [traces](/overview/types/traces) are enabled, this links to
  [Trace Explorer](/investigate/querying/traces).
- **View events**: When [change events](/overview/types/change-events) are enabled,
  this link opens
  [Changes Explorer](/observe/enable-events/use-events#view-change-events).

### Ownership

The **Ownership** section displays the SLO's **Owner**, which is a service or collection.
Its **Policy** links to the SLO's selected
[notification policy](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies).

### Labels and annotations

**Labels** are key-value pairs that filter the SLO to specific telemetry. For
example, you might have a service with a label of `service` and a value of
`payment-gateway`. These values display sequentially.

**Annotations** are key-value pairs that provide additional information for events.

### Service dashboards

Observability Platform generates a list of **Service dashboards** based on the
dashboards attached to the service that owns the SLO.
