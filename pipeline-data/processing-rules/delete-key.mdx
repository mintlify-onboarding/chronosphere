The delete keys [processing rule](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) deletes a
specified key and its associated value from every record that passes through your
pipeline.

## Configuration parameters

<Params />

| Name        | Key         | Description | Default |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Key**     | `key` | Required. The key to delete from your records. You can use [record accessor syntax](/pipeline-data/processing-rules#record-accessor-syntax) to reference keys nested within another object. | _none_ |
| **Comment** | `comment` | A custom note or description of the rule's function. This text is displayed next to the rule's name in the **Actions** list in the processing rules interface. | _none_ |

## Example

Using the block keys rule lets you pare down telemetry data by eliminating
key/value pairs you don't want to keep.

For example, given the following sample website log data:

```json
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","user_id":4,"page_id":10,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","user_id":5,"page_id":40,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","user_id":1,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z","user_id":2,"page_id":40,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z","user_id":1,"page_id":20,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","user_id":2,"page_id":50,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z","user_id":2,"page_id":10,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"view"}
```

A processing rule with the **Key** value `user_id` returns the following result:

```json
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","action":"purchase","page_id":30}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","action":"purchase","page_id":10}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z","action":"click","page_id":50}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","action":"purchase","page_id":40}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","action":"purchase","page_id":30}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z","action":"click","page_id":40}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z","action":"click","page_id":30}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z","action":"view","page_id":20}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","action":"purchase","page_id":50}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z","action":"view","page_id":10}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z","action":"view","page_id":50}
```

This rule removed the `user_id` key and its associated values from each log entry.
