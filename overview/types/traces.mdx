[Distributed tracing](/overview/concepts/distributed-tracing) is the process of
mapping and analyzing requests as they flow through a distributed system. Use the
following documentation to learn about how to interact with trace data in
Chronosphere Observability Platform.

## Ingest

Observability Platform supports ingesting trace data with both the Chronosphere
Collector and the OpenTelemetry Collector. An added benefit of using the
OpenTelemetry Collector is configuring [head sampling](/control/sampling/head-sampling),
which is a powerful control mechanism for managing your tracing costs.

## Query

Learn how to construct queries in Trace Explorer to search for traces and spans to
help identify, triage, and understand the root cause of problems. See the
[features overview](/investigate/querying/traces/features) to learn more about the
capabilities that Trace Explorer provides.

  />
</Columns>

## Observe

Create standard dashboards query and
[visualize log data](/investigate/querying/dashboard-query) queries. You can also
create [alerts](/investigate/alerts/monitors) to watch time series data that's
specified in a monitor query, and receive notifications when the query matches
specified logs.

</Columns>

## Connect

Create links to related data from other parts of Observability Platform, such as
linking to logs from traces and linking to traces from dashboards.

  />
</Columns>

## Analyze

Analyze your trace data to gain insights, understand the value of your data
semantics, and highlight changes and their impacts. Use
[differential diagnosis](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/traces)
to identify issues behind suspicious trends.

  />
</Columns>

## Control

Use the Chronosphere Trace Control Plane to narrow your focus to only a
representative sample of your data and drop everything else. Identify and evaluate
data, and then sample the overall dataset to eliminate waste, unnecessary noise, and
cost.
