title: Control your telemetry data
'og:description': Learn about how to control your telemetry data with Chronosphere Observability Platform.

{/* -- dri: Adam Locke -- */}


Your app generates a lot of data, but not all of it's useful. Storing every byte is
costly, and can quickly overwhelm your capacity limit, license limit, or both. Aside
from financial cost, there's computing cost associated with generating, processing,
and temporarily storing your telemetry data.

Reducing telemetry data volume keeps costs predictable and manageable as your
business scales, and helps teams manage their data effectively by reducing the amount
of available information. When you optimize your telemetry data, on-call engineers
can find the data they need to solve problems faster.

To take control of your telemetry data, Chronosphere Observability Platform provides
multiple tools you can use to identify and eliminate data that isn't used and doesn't
deliver value to your business. See [Chronosphere control concepts](/control/storage)
to learn about the mechanisms you can use to control your telemetry data.

performance.

## Understand consumption and limits

Manage license consumption by
[reviewing licensing dashboards](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards#licensing-overview)
to identify usage trends and avoid exceeding your organization's licensing limits.

[Understand telemetry data limits](/administer/limits-licensing) for each telemetry type to ensure a
performant experience when ingesting, querying, and creating resources.

## Shape metric data

Use the Chronosphere Control Plane to [shape your metric data](/control/shaping) and
reduce the amount of telemetry data you persist. Manage your telemetry data with
tools that help you shape that traffic, such as creating drop rules, quotas, and
aggregation rules.

## Sample trace data

Create [trace datasets](/control/sampling/datasets) that map tracing license
consumption to relevant business units in your organization. Datasets let you track
and measure trace data usage over time before you implement sampling strategies,
whereas head and tail sampling alone require you to measure and implement together.

By parsing out the ability to measure and track trace data volume, you can create
datasets, learn about how trace data is processed and persisted, and then apply
[behaviors](/control/sampling/behaviors) to set sampling rules for your datasets
without having to write, coordinate, and manage head and tail sampling rules
individually.

## Control log data

Understanding your license consumption helps identify where you're spending the most
money on your log data, and which services or operations are consuming the most of
your license capacity. [Control log data](/control/consumption) to determine what
portion of your license is allocated to the most important data.

Create [partitions](/control/consumption/partitions) to provide a structure for
attributing costs to different groups in your organization, and then define
[budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting) to assign percentages of your license
consumption to each partition.
