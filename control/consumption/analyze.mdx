After [creating partitions](/control/consumption/partitions), use the
[Logging License Consumption](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards#logging-license-consumption)
dashboard to view persisted log data consumption against license capacity. This
dashboard provides information you can use to analyze consumption across partitions
to detect unwanted spikes and understand what's driving growth.

This dashboard monitors log data consumption against your contract, including the
consumption by volume over time and the consumption of each
[partition](/control/consumption/partitions) and any defined
[budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting).

Use this dashboard to review budget [thresholds](/control/consumption/budgeting#threshold-types),
which help to detect growth patterns in partitions. This information can help to
manage both anomalous spikes in data and slow data growth over time.

To analyze log data consumption:

1. In the navigation menu select **<Icon icon="dashboard" alt="Dashboards"/> Dashboards**.
1. In the search bar, enter `Logging License Consumption`.
1. Click the name of the dashboard to open it.
1. Use the **Instant Rate Threshold** and **Volume Threshold** panel groups to review
   cumulative consumption trends across various time windows and partitions to
   understand what's driving growth:

   - The rolling period panels help identify recurring anomalies in volume over rolling
     time windows, such as one- or three-hour periods.
   - The instant rate threshold panels help detect data spikes in real time.
   - The fixed period panels identify gradual usage growth or sustained
     overconsumption patterns in cumulative log volumes across daily, weekly, or
     monthly windows.

1. In the dashboard, use the **Partition** menu to select the partition you want to
   view consumption data for.
1. To investigate the source of consumption, in the **Explore** panel group, click
   the **Logs Explorer** link.

   Logs Explorer opens with a predefined query from the dashboard.
1. In Logs Explorer, use the provided filters to identify patterns and trends in
   sources of consumption.

## Next steps

Based on your findings, you might want to refine your
[partitions](/control/consumption/partitions) with more granular dimensions, such as
adding more child partitions to apply greater levels of control.

After analyzing your consumption and refining partitions, add
[budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting) to apply optional shaping policies that you
can attach to a partition to provide guardrails to avoid usage overages and
overspending.
