In addition to creating comprehensive [custom pipelines](/pipeline-data/create-modify),
you can deploy a standalone agent to collect observability data. Chronosphere
Telemetry Pipeline supports these agent types:

- [Fluent Bit](#fluent-bit)
- [Core Agent](#core-agent)

<Info>
You can either send data directly from an agent to the destination of your
choice, or send data from an agent to an intermediary pipeline before it reaches
its final destination. The latter method lets you take advantage of features
like [processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules).

## Fluent Bit

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is a lightweight, open source telemetry
agent for logs, metrics, and traces. Although Chronosphere now sponsors its
development, Fluent Bit is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) graduated sub-project
and remains licensed under the terms of the
[Apache License v2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

For information about setting up and using Fluent Bit, refer to the
[Fluent Bit documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual).

## Core Agent

Core Agent is an enterprise fork of Fluent Bit available to Chronosphere customers.
It offers extended support for maintenance and security fixes.
