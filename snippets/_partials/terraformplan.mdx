When you run `terraform plan` to generate an execution plan, Chronosphere automatically
  tests configurations that include notification policies by submitting them as dry runs.
  For details, see the
  [Terraform provider](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform#validate-plans-with-dry-runs)
  documentation.
