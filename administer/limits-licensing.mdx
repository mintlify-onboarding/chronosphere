Based on and defined in your contract with Chronosphere are _license limits_. These
limits track your telemetry usage against your licensing capacity. Examples of license
limits are Persisted Writes, Matched Writes, and Persisted Cardinality.

These limits are separate from _system limits_, which are technical constraints
defined by the Chronosphere system and can't be modified by anyone, including
Chronosphere Support. Each telemetry type in Chronosphere has determined system
limits, which ensure stability, and optimize for performance across Chronosphere
Observability Platform.
