  output logs, and load-balanced endpoints.

### Pipeline CLI [#cli-v2-12-0]

- Added the ability to set a `tolerations` parameter for new Core Instances,
  which sets pod tolerations to the Core Instance and propagates that value to
  pipeline replicas. For example:

    ```shell copy
    calyptia create core_instance operator --name test8900 --tolerations key1=Exists:-:NoSchedule,key2=Equal:val2:PreferNoSchedule
    ```

- Added the ability to immediately create a fleet with files by using the `create`
  endpoint.
- _Fix_: Improved performance by adding SQL index to pipeline statuses and configuration.
- _Fix_: Empty arrays now initialize to `[]` instead of `null` in the cluster object
  regular expressions API.

- Updated sync to accept the new `tolerations` parameter.
- The Core Instance `tolerations` parameter is now propagated to pipeline
  replica sets.
- Updated Helm chart to include the `skipServiceCreation` parameter. This
  parameter disables the creation of new Kubernetes services for all pipelines in
  the Core Instance. For example:

    ```shell copy
    helm install ci calyptia/core-instance --set "skipServiceCreation=true" --set "coreInstance=12l34" --set "cloudToken=1l234"
    ```

- Updated Helm chart to include the `tolerations` parameter. For example:

    ```shell copy
    helm install ci core-instance/ --set "tolerations=key1=Equal:value1:Execute:3600\,key2=Exists:value2:NoExecute" --set "coreInstance=12l34" --set "cloudToken=1l234"
    ```

- _Fix_: Fixed an issue with annotations flag parsing that affected comma-separated values.
