_Signals_ use a unique set of labels to create groups of notifications when a monitor
alert triggers or resolves. The groups display information from your monitor queries
that aggregation might otherwise remove. Use signals to reduce the number of
notifications sent, or to improve visibility by showing each time series alert.

Signals use the following defaults:

- Alerts send for the initial and any subsequent triggers for all signal types.
- All monitors default to `per monitor` when created unless you choose another
  option.
- Chronosphere Observability Platform sends an additional notification every five
  minutes when a new time series alert triggers.
- If an alert remains active but no new time series trigger, Observability Platform
  sends a notification every hour.
- Signals use the [notification policies](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies) set
  in Observability Platform.

Use the following options to group alerts, which affects how many notifications
Observability Platform sends:

- **Per monitor (one alert):** Sends one notification containing all time series that
  meet the conditions. Use this option if you want only one notification that
  contains all time series.
- **Per signal (multiple alerts):** Sends one notification for each group in your
  monitor. Helpful for logically grouping time series into the same alert.
- **Per time series (many alerts):** Sends one notification for every time series
  returned by the monitor query. This option sends the most alerts, but is helpful if
  you want a notification for every time series that triggers your query.

Signal notifications have the following behaviors:

- Each signal alerts at most once every five minutes.
- If alerts within a given signal change, Observability Platform renotifies, even
  if the signal happened within the five minute interval.
- If alerts within a given signal don't change, the signal renotifies when the
  repeat interval elapses.

You can configure a signal for an existing monitor or when
[creating a new monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors#create-a-monitor).

<Info>
Observability Platform reserves specific Prometheus labels such as `alertname` and
`severity`. Observability Platform also uses the `severity` label to group alerts,
except when a monitor specifies a signal per series.

Refer to the [Prometheus metric naming recommendations](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/mappings/prometheus/prometheus-recommendations)
for additional information.

## View signals

Select from the following methods to view and signals on monitors.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="view-available-signals-cloud">

On the **Monitors** page, monitors with defined signals display
the <Icon icon="folder-tree" /> file tree icon.

To view signals:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerts <span aria-label="and then">></span> Monitors**.
1. Select the monitor to view.

Signals for the monitor display in the **Signals** section of the monitor definition.
Click a signal to deselect it.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="view-available-signals-chronoctl">

Use [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) to view signals for a specific monitor with the
`monitors list` command by passing the slug as the `slugs`
argument.

To return a monitor with the slug `default-monitor`:

```shell
chronoctl monitors list --slugs default-monitor
```

The signals for the monitor display in the returned monitor definition.

[Use the Code Config tool](/investigate/alerts/monitors#use-the-code-config-tool) in
Observability Platform to view the monitor's Chronoctl YAML representation.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Terraform" id="view-available-signals-terraform">

[Use the Code Config tool](/investigate/alerts/monitors#use-the-code-config-tool) in
Observability Platform to view a monitor's Terraform representation.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Edit signals

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerts <span aria-label="and then">></span> Monitors**
   and select the monitor to edit.
1. Click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots icon and select
   **Edit Monitor**.
1. Scroll to the **Signals** section and select one of the following options:

   - **Per monitor (one alert):** Observability Platform sends a notification using
     your selected [notification policy](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies). It includes
     all time series triggered by the monitor. This alert can send additional
     notifications if new time series trigger.
   - **Per signal (multiple alerts):** In the **Label Key** field, choose the
     label to group alerts from this monitor. To add more label keys, click the
     <Icon icon="plus" /> add icon.

     You can use query aggregation to include or exclude specific labels. For
     example, create a query to group results by only the `namespace` and `instance`
     labels:

     ```text
     count by (namespace, instance) (up)
     ```

   - **Per time series (many alerts):** The monitor sends a notification for every
     time series as it triggers. You can change the alert behavior or channel by
     changing the policy for the monitor or editing the
     [notification policy](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies).

## Signal examples

Use the following examples to help you use signals, by type.

### Per monitor

This example query generates a single notification that includes all alerting time
series.

1. Enter the following query in the **Query** field, and select **15s** as the check
   interval:

   ```text
   count by (namespace, job, instance) ({instance!="", namespace~=""})
   ```

1. In the **Signals** section, select **Per monitor (one alert)**.

1. In the **Conditions** section, select **Critical**, choose **is >** as the
   operator, and enter `5s` in the **Sustain** field.

When the critical condition matches any time series, a single notification sends that
includes all alerting time series.

### Per signal

In this example, you configure a query to track outages and use signals to track
multiple time series.

Four teams (`frontend`, `backend`, `database`, and `search`) are working on different
components of a project. Each component has a set of services and resources its team
monitors for performance and availability.

Observability Platform ingests these metrics:

```text
resource_status{component="frontend", resource_type="availability", service_name="web_app"} 0
resource_status{component="frontend", resource_type="performance", service_name="web_app"} 0
resource_status{component="backend", resource_type="availability", service_name="api"} 0
resource_status{component="database", resource_type="availability", service_name="db_cluster_1"} 0
resource_status{component="database", resource_type="availability", service_name="db_cluster_2"} 0
resource_status{component="database", resource_type="availability", service_name="db_cluster_3"} 0
resource_status{component="search", resource_type="performance", service_name="search_engine"} 92
resource_status{component="search", resource_type="availability", service_name="search_engine"} 100
```

Each monitored service sends a metric to Observability Platform called
`resource_status`. This metric has the following labels:

- `component`: The component and team name.
- `resource_type`: Either `availability` or `performance` for a tracked metric
   resource.
- `service_name`: The name of the service.

To define the signals for this data:

1. Enter the following query in the **Query** field to alert your teams when a
   resource isn't working as expected, and select **15s** as the check interval:

   ```text
   resource_status == 0
   ```

   This query looks for a status of `0`, which indicates a service failure.

1. In the **Signals** field, select **Per signal (multiple alerts)** and enter the
   following labels in the **Label key** field to send the `component` and
   `resource_type` information when an alert triggers:

   ```text
   component,resource_type
   ```

1. In the **Conditions** section, select **Critical**, choose **is >** as the
   operator, and enter **5s** in the **Sustain** field.

When a matching alert triggers:

- The `frontend` team receives a notification with these metrics:

   ```text
   resource_status{component="frontend", resource_type="availability", service_name="web_app"} 0
   resource_status{component="frontend", resource_type="performance", service_name="web_app"} 0
   ```

- The `backend` team receives a notification with this metric:

   ```text
   resource_status{component="backend", resource_type="availability", service_name="api"} 0
   ```

- The `database` team receives a notification with these metrics:

   ```text
   resource_status{component="database", resource_type="availability", service_name="db_cluster_1"} 0
   resource_status{component="database", resource_type="availability", service_name="db_cluster_2"} 0
   resource_status{component="database", resource_type="availability", service_name="db_cluster_3"} 0
   ```

The search team doesn't receive any alerts because their services are functioning.

### Per time series

This example uses the same query and condition as in the [per signal](#per-signal)
example. The difference is that in the **Signals** field, select
**Per time series (many alerts)**.

1. Enter the following query in the **Query** field, and select **15s** as the check
   interval:

   ```text
   count by (namespace, job, instance) ({instance!="", namespace~=""})
   ```

1. In the **Signals** field, select **Per time series (many alerts)** and
   enter the following labels in the **Label key** field to send the `component` and
   `resource_type` information when an alert triggers:

   ```text
   component,resource_type
   ```

1. In the **Conditions** section, select **Critical**, choose **is >** as the
   operator, and enter `5s` in the **Sustain** field.

When the critical condition matches, a notification for each time series in the
monitor query triggers using your notification policy.
