title: Use OpenTelemetry protocol endpoints
description: Learn how to configure and use Chronosphere Observability Platform endpoints for OpenTelemetry protocol ingestion of log data.
---
{/* -- dri: Adam Locke -- */}


Chronosphere Observability Platform supports ingesting log data using OpenTelemetry
protocol (OTLP) HTTP ingestion endpoints.

<Info>
For best results, ingest telemetry through a local OpenTelemetry Collector or Fluent
Bit for processing and batching. Sending telemetry directly from an OpenTelemetry SDK
can be less reliable.
</Info>

## Requirements

Your OTLP configuration must meet certain requirements.

- **`API-Token` header:** All requests must include the `API-Token` HTTP header,
  with the API token of a valid [service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts)
  with write permissions as the value.
- **OTLP version support:** Only v1.0 and higher are supported.
- **Supported compression methods:** Chronosphere supports both `gzip` and `zstd`
  compression.
- **Encryption:** All requests must be encrypted using TLS.

### Recommendations

Chronosphere recommends setting the timeout value for a logs request to 30 seconds,
and to enable retries to prevent transient network errors from causing data loss.

## OTLP endpoint URLs

Observability Platform provides HTTP endpoints for logs, metrics, and traces.

| Telemetry type | HTTP endpoint URL                                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logs           | `https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/data/opentelemetry/v1/logs`    |
| Metrics        | `https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/data/opentelemetry/v1/metrics` |
| Traces         | `https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/data/opentelemetry/v1/traces`  |

Replace `TENANT` with your organization prefixed to your Observability Platform
instance. For example, _`MY_ORGANIZATION`_`.chronosphere.io`.

OpenTelemetry exporters complete the path based on the telemetry type. For the
`otlphttp` exporter, set the endpoint base path as follows:

```yaml copy
exporters:
  otlphttp/chronosphere:
    endpoint: https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/data/opentelemetry/
    compression: zstd
    headers:
      API-Token: ${env:API_TOKEN}
    ...
```
