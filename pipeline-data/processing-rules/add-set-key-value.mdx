The add/set key/value [processing rule](/pipeline-data/processing-rules)
adds the same key/value pair to every record that passes through your pipeline. If a
record contains a matching key, this rule overwrites that key's associated value with
the value you specify.

## Configuration parameters

<Params />

| Name        | Key | Description | Default |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Key**     | `key` | Required. The key to add to each record. You can use [record accessor syntax](/pipeline-data/processing-rules#record-accessor-syntax) to add or overwrite keys nested inside a parent object. | _none_ |
| **Value**   | `value` | Required. The value to associate with your key. This value is identical for every instance of **Key**. | _none_ |
| **Comment** | `comment` | A custom note or description of the rule's function. This text is displayed next to the rule's name in the **Actions** list in the processing rules interface. | _none_ |

## Example

Using the add/set key/value rule lets you add identifying information to events,
such as including the source from which they originate or their associated user
action.

For example, given this sample log data:

```json
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase", "source": "storefront"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","user_id":4,"page_id":10,"action":"purchase", "source": "storefront"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","user_id":5,"page_id":40,"action":"purchase", "source": "storefront"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","user_id":1,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase", "source": "storefront"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z","user_id":2,"page_id":40,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z","user_id":1,"page_id":20,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","user_id":2,"page_id":50,"action":"purchase", "source": "storefront"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z","user_id":2,"page_id":10,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"view"}
```

A rule with the **Key** value `source` and the **Value** value `acme-wholesale` returns the
following result:

```json
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":4,"page_id":10,"action":"purchase","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"click","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":5,"page_id":40,"action":"purchase","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":1,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":2,"page_id":40,"action":"click","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"click","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":1,"page_id":20,"action":"view","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":2,"page_id":50,"action":"purchase","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":2,"page_id":10,"action":"view","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z"}
{"source":"acme-wholesale","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"view","timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z"}
```

A `source` key is now included for each record, with the value `acme-wholesale`.
Records that already had a key named `source` had their values replaced with the new
value.
