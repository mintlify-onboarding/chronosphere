The [Prometheus Remote-Write 2.0 API](https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/prw/remote_write_spec_2_0/)
provides a standard interface for sending metrics data from Prometheus servers to
compatible receivers.

Chronosphere Observability Platform supports metrics ingestion by providing Prometheus
remote write HTTP ingestion endpoints.

## Remote write endpoints

The Prometheus Remote-Write 2.0 API provides a standard interface for sending metrics
data from Prometheus servers to compatible receivers. For Chronosphere Observability Platform,
the best practice is to use the
[Prometheus Agent](/ingest/metrics-traces/prometheus-remote-write/prometheus-agent)
to send metrics with batching and retries.

However, when using the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/ingest/metrics-traces/otel),
use the OTLP exporter to send metrics instead of the Prometheus Remote Write exporter.

The remote write endpoint URL is:

```text
https://<COMPANY>.chronosphere.io/data/metrics/api/v1/prom/remote/write
```

Replace `<COMPANY>` with your tenant name as used in your Observability Platform
URL.

## Prometheus Agent

To get started with Prometheus remote write, configure
[Prometheus Agent](/ingest/metrics-traces/prometheus-remote-write/prometheus-agent).
