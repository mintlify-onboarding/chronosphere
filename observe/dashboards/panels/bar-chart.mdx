A _bar chart_ visualizes numeric data returned by a [query](/investigate/querying).
The chart depicts a specified value, such as the last numeric value in a time series
or the result's sum, average, or minimum or maximum value, as a bar.

Using Chronosphere Observability Platform, you can visualize the results of multiple
queries in a single bar chart panel to visually compare them. This can help you
quickly compare relative values from related queries, such as resource usage of
different services, a single service at different points in time, or cumulative
failure and error counts.

To create a bar chart or learn more about the configuration options common
to all panels, see [Panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).

## Use a bar chart's tooltip

When you hold the pointer over a bar in a bar chart, Observability Platform displays
a tooltip that shows the bar's full label and value.

## Bar chart queries

Bar charts use one or more
[queries](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-query) to retrieve data to
visualize. Bar charts use the following query **Options** to refine the
displayed information, depending on your **Datasource**:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Metrics (Prometheus)">

- <DashboardSeriesNaming />
- **Type**: The [PromQL query](/investigate/querying/promql#basic-querying)
  type: **Instant**, or **Range**.
<DashboardDownsampleTruncate />

</Tab>
<Tab title="Logs">

<DashboardSeriesNaming />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure a bar chart

You can configure a bar chart by [modifying its **Settings**](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).

Any changes you make in the panel's **Settings** tab are reflect immediately in
the **Preview** pane, but take effect only when you click **Apply** in the **Edit panel**
interface and then **Save** the dashboard.

Observability Platform doesn't fully support directly editing a panel's JSON
representation. Instead, configure panels directly in the user interface. Use the JSON
representation only for managing your configuration as code with tools such as
[Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) and [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform).

### Miscellaneous settings

The **Misc** tab contains these settings:

- **Mode**: Determines whether the panel depicts a bar's numeric value as its literal
  **Value** or as a **Percentage** of the sum of all bars in the chart.
- **Sort**: Determines how the bar chart sorts the rendered bars.
  - **Default** sorts the bars in their original data order.
  - **Ascending** sorts the bars from the lowest value at the top, to the highest
      value at the bottom. **Descending** sorts in the opposite direction.
- **Limit**: The maximum number of returned values.

### Modify units and formatting

The **Unit and formatting** section changes the display of units on the chart.

<DashboardUnits />

### Modify a bar chart's thresholds

The **Thresholds** section in a chart's **Settings** tab defines values
where Observability Platform renders threshold lines over the chart. You can define
threshold values as either absolute numeric values or percentiles. Observability
Platform renders threshold lines as dashed lines.

The threshold's **Mode** defines whether all thresholds use **Absolute** numeric
values or **Percent** values. Percent values are relative to the Y axis' minimum and
maximum. Defaults to **Absolute**.

To create a new threshold:

1. Click the plus sign (**+**) in the **Thresholds** section header.
1. In the field that appears, enter a value where you want Observability Platform to
   render the threshold line.
1. Optional: Click the color indicator, depicted as a colored circle, to open a
   selector where you can choose a color for the threshold line.
1. Optional: Click the caret (**>**) to expand the threshold definition, and enter text
   in the **Label** field to display on the chart if the threshold is met. This
   text displays when you hold the pointer over the area of the chart exceeding the
   threshold.
1. In the **Edit panel** dialog, click **Apply** to save your changes.
1. After you've finished editing the panel, click **Save** on the dashboard to save
   your changes.

To delete a threshold line, click the caret (**>**) to expand the threshold definition,
and then click the **<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete** icon
on its corresponding row of the Thresholds section.

### Modify a bar chart's colors

The **Advanced** tab in a bar chart's **Edit panel** interface contains an **Override**
section where you can add, remove, and configure colors. You can apply color overrides
to a specific series or all series that match a
[regular expression](/investigate/querying/regular-expressions).
