A _collection_ is a group of Chronosphere Observability Platform resources, such as
[dashboards](/observe/dashboards) and [monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors), associated with a
service or feature you want to monitor.

A [_team_](/administer/accounts-teams/teams), consisting of
[_user accounts_](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts) and
[_service accounts_](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts) that share
responsibility for the service or feature, is also responsible for each collection.

Collections help service and feature owners manage their services at scale and
streamline incident response by consolidating all relevant information about a
service or feature into one place, and sharing access to that information with
everyone in its responsible team.

For example, to ensure that your team and on-call engineers all have full context for
a service, you can create a collection for it that provides direct access to its
monitors, dashboards, and the team members who can respond to incidents.
Observability Platform then provides a menu of a team's collections to its members
who can quickly review resources most relevant to their services, and a homepage for
the collection that the team can share with on-call engineers or other stakeholders.

## View collections

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="view-collections-cloud">

To search for a collection:

1. Click the search bar to focus on it, or use the keyboard shortcut
   `Control+K` (`Command+K` on macOS).
   1. Begin typing any part of the collection's name.
   1. Optional: Click the filters for all other listed resource types at the top of
      the search results to remove them and display only collections.
   1. Click the search result you're interested in, or use the arrow keys to select
      it and press `Enter` (`Return` on macOS), to select that
      collection.

To browse collections by their respective teams, in the navigation menu click
**<CollectionNavIcon /> Collections**. Collections associated with teams that
you belong to appear first, followed by lists of **All Teams & Collections**
and **Unowned Collections**. To expand the latter lists, click the list's
<Icon icon="chevron-down" /> expand icon.

If you have administative privileges, you can view a filterable list.

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Admin** and
   then select
   **<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Collections**.
   Clicking a collection or team in this table takes you to their respective
   homepages.

   - To filter this table by keyword, click **Search collections** and begin typing.
     The table automatically updates to display only the matching collections.
   - To filter this list by teams, select them in the **Select a Team** dropdown.
   - To display only collections that lack an owner, enable the **Unowned Collections Only**
     toggle.

You can optionally select collections by checking the checkbox on each collection's
row, which reveals an **Edit Team Association** button. Clicking this button allows
you to select a parent team for all selected collections. If you select a team,
click **Save** to save the edited association. For more Collection editing features,
see [Edit a Collection](#edit-a-collection).

</Tab>

<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="view-collections-chronoctl">

To view a list of all collections using [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl), use the
`collections list` command:

```shell
chronoctl collections list
```

This returns a list of YAML documents separated by three dashes (`---`), each
representing a collection:

```yaml
api_version: v1/config
kind: Collection
spec:
  slug: example-collection
  name: Example Collection
  team_slug: example-team
  description: Example Team - Example Collection
```

To complete this action with the Chronosphere API, use the
[`ListCollections`](/tooling/api-info/definition/operations/ListCollections) endpoint.

<ApiAuthReq />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create a collection

You can use Observability Platform to create Terraform, Chronoctl, or API
configurations, which you must then apply using the respective application.

Collections use a `slug` as an identifier. [Services](/observe/services) also use a
`slug`. Collection and service slugs can have the same value.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="create-a-collection-cloud">

To create a collection, you must have administrative privileges.

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin**
   and then click
   **<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Collections**.
1. Click **Create collection**.
1. In the dialog that appears, enter a descriptive name in the **Collection Name**
   field. Observability Platform displays this name anywhere that it refers to this
   collection.
1. Optional: Click the **Parent team** dropdown and select a team to which
   you're associating this collection. If the dropdown doesn't contain any teams,
   you can create one.
1. Optional: Enter a description in the **Collection Description** field.
   Observability Platform displays this description when you view this collection's
   homepage.
1. Click **Save**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="create-a-collection-chronoctl">

To create a collection using [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl), apply a `Collection` resource.
The resource contains these fields:

| Field                      | Type   | Description |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `name`                     | String | The collection name as displayed in Observability Platform. |
| `slug`                     | String | Optional. A unique identifier that Observability Platform uses to identify the collection. If omitted, Observability Platform generates a slug. |
| `team_slug`                | String | Optional. The slug of the team with which you're associating with this collection. |
| `description`              | String | A description displayed when viewing this collection. |
| `notification_policy_slug` | String | The slug of a notification policy that you're associating with this collection. |

For example, this resource creates a new collection named `DBAs` with the slug
`dbas-collection` and associated with `dbas-team`:

```yaml
api_version: v1/config
kind: Collection
spec:
  slug: dbas-collection
  name: DBAs
  team_slug: dbas-team
  description: Collection of database-related resources.
  notification_policy_slug: dbas-policy
```

To create the collection:

1. Save the `Collection` resource definition to a file, such as `collection.yaml`.
1. Test the changes with a dry run:

   ```shell
   chronoctl collections create -f collection.yaml -d
   ```

1. Apply the changes:

   ```shell
   chronoctl collections create -f collection.yaml
   ```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Terraform" id="create-a-collection-terraform">

To create a collection using [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform), use
the `chronosphere_collection` resource type.

| Field                    | Type   | Description |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----------- |
| `name`                   | String | The collection name as displayed in Observability Platform. |
| `slug`                   | String | Optional. A unique identifier that Observability Platform uses to identify the collection. If omitted, Observability Platform generates a slug. |
| `team_id`                | String | Optional. The identifier of the team with which you're associating with this collection. |
| `description`            | String | A description displayed when viewing this collection. |
| `notification_policy_id` | String | Optional. The identifier of a notification policy that you're associating with this collection. |

For example, this resource creates a new collection that Terraform refers to as
`databases`, names it `Databases` in Observability Platform, provides a description, associates
the collection with a notification policy, and assigns the collection to the team `dbas`:

```ruby
resource "chronosphere_collection" "infra" {
  name        = "Databases"
  team_id     = chronosphere_team.dbas.id
  description = "Collection of resources related to database services."
  notification_policy_id = chronosphere_notification_policy.np.id
}
```
