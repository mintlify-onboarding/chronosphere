title: Automated Kubernetes logging
'og:description': Use Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline to route logs from a Kubernetes cluster.
---
{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


You can use automated logging to route Kubernetes data through Chronosphere
Telemetry Pipeline. Automated logging pulls logs from services running inside the
Kubernetes cluster where you deployed a Core Instance, then sends those logs to
one or more destinations.

## Enable automated logging

To enable automated logging in Telemetry Pipeline:

1. Sign in to the [Telemetry Pipeline web interface](https://core.calyptia.com/).
1. Open the project that contains the Core Instance where you want to set up
   automated logging.
1. Go to **Core Instances**, then click the name of the Core Instance where you'd
   like to set up automated logging.
1. Next to **Kubernetes Namespaces**, click the
   <Icon icon="chevron-down" alt="Expand"/>&nbsp;icon, then click **Automate logging**.
1. In the dialog that appears, select one of the available
   [destinations](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins)
   to determine where your logs will be sent.
1. Configure the settings for your chosen destination plugin, then click **Save**.

## Modify automated logging settings

<Info>
If you're trying to modify these settings immediately after enabling automated logging
in a Core Instance, you might need to refresh your browser to make these menus
appear.
</Info>

After you've set up automated logging, you can add additional destinations to
your Core Instance or adjust the settings for any existing destinations. To
modify automated logging settings in Telemetry Pipeline:

1. Sign in to the [Telemetry Pipeline web interface](https://core.calyptia.com/).
1. Open the project that contains the Core Instance whose automated logging settings
   you want to modify.
1. Go to **Core Instances**, then click the name of the Core Instance whose
   automated logging settings you want to modify.
1. Under **Kubernetes Namespaces**, click any item in the **Destinations** list.
   This opens the pipeline builder.
1. Use the pipeline builder to modify your Kubernetes sources, destination plugins,
   or [processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules#add-processing-rules-to-your-pipeline).

## Disable automated logging

<Warning>
If you disable automated logging, any destination settings you've configured
will be deleted permanently. To re-enable automated logging, you'll need to reconfigure
your destination settings.
</Warning>

To disable automated logging in Telemetry Pipeline:

1. Sign in to the [Telemetry Pipeline web interface](https://core.calyptia.com/).
1. Open the project that contains the Core Instance where you want to disable
   automated logging.
1. Go to **Core Instances**, then click the name of the Core Instance where you'd
   like to disable automated logging.
1. Next to **Kubernetes Namespaces**, click
   **Disable&nbsp;<Icon icon="pause" />**.
