When you [create or modify a pipeline](/pipeline-data/create-modify), you can
test the source and destination plugins in that pipeline to ensure
their configuration settings are correct.

Chronosphere recommends testing plugins individually rather than as a group, which
can help identify and isolate issues with each plugin.

## Test a source plugin

To confirm that a source plugin is configured correctly, route data from that source
to a basic test destination.

1. Add the source plugin of your choice to a pipeline and configure its settings
   accordingly.
1. Add the [Standard output](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) destination plugin
   to the same pipeline. This plugin lets you view telemetry data as it passes
   through your pipeline in the Telemetry Pipeline web interface.
1. In Telemetry Pipeline, navigate to the [pipeline details](/pipeline-navigate#pipeline-details) page.
1. In the [**Pipeline Output**](/pipeline-navigate#pipeline-output) section,
   click **Get Latest Logs**.
1. Confirm that **Pipeline Output** displays data from your source. For
   example, if you're using the [Kubernetes Events](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins/kubernetes)
   source plugin, this output should include data generated by a Kubernetes cluster.

If **Pipeline Output** displays data from your source, the associated source
plugin is configured correctly. You can either remove the Standard output plugin
from your pipeline or copy the source plugin's configuration settings to use
them in a different pipeline.

## Test a destination plugin

To confirm that a destination plugin is configured correctly, send basic test data
to that destination.

1. Add the destination plugin of your choice to a pipeline and configure its
   settings accordingly.
1. Choose a source plugin to generate test data that's compatible with your
   destination:
   - The [Datagen](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins/datagen),
   [Dummy HTTP](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins/dummy-http),
   and [Mock Data](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins/mock-data) source plugins
   generate test logs.
   - The [Dummy logs, metrics, and traces](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins/dummy)
   source plugin can generate all three telemetry types.
1. Add that source plugin to the same pipeline and configure its settings accordingly.
1. Access the storage location associated with your destination plugin to confirm
   whether that destination is receiving test data. For example, if you're using the
   [Amazon S3](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins/amazon-s3) destination
   plugin, look for test logs in your S3 bucket.

If your destination is receiving test data, the associated destination plugin is
configured correctly. You can either remove the testing source plugin from your
pipeline or copy the destination plugin's configuration settings to use them in
a different pipeline.
