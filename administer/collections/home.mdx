Each [*team*](/administer/accounts-teams/teams) and
[*collection*](/administer/collections) provides a *home*
page that lists its associated resources.

These pages provide an overview of alerting [monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors)
and their statuses, links to associated [dashboards](/observe/dashboards),
and additional context about the team or collection.

## View a home page

To go to a team's or collection's home page:
{/* vale off */}

{/* "my" is in the UI and unavoidable */}

1. In the navigation menu exit the **Admin** menu (if needed, click
   **<Icon icon="arrow-right-from-bracket" /> Exit Admin**) and select
   **<CollectionNavIcon /> Collections**. Chronosphere Observability Platform first
   lists collections associated with teams to which you belong under
   **My Teams & Collections**, then under **All Teams & Collections** lists each
   <Icon icon="users" /> team and the <CollectionIcon /> collections
   it's responsible for.
1. Click a team or collection to view its home page.

{/* vale on */}

### Alerting monitors

The **Monitors** section includes a table that lists any
[monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors) associated with this team or
collection that are reporting alerts. The table's columns provide pertinent details
and links to each monitor:

- **Status:** The table lists any monitors associated with the team or collection
  that have active alerts, sorted by descending severity from
  <Icon icon="hexagon-exclamation" /> critical to
  <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" /> warning levels.

  Monitors not reporting alerts, including fully muted monitors, aren't listed here.
  To view all monitors associated with this team or collection, click the section's
  **View all monitors** link.

- **Name:** Each alerting monitor's name is a link to its **Monitor Info** view.

- **Alerting For:** This indicates the duration since the monitor triggered the
  alert.

- **Notification Policy:** When viewing a collection, each alerting monitor links to
  its [notification policy](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies).

- **Collection:** When viewing a team, each alerting monitor links to its associated
  collection home page.

Team home pages exclusively show links to each dashboard's associated collection.

The **Links** section contains links added to a team or collection home. These links
can point to any `http` or `https` URL.

### Description

Teams and collections can have a text description that's displayed in the
**Description** section of their home pages. This description can also appear in
other lists that include teams or collections, or when listing them in
[Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl).

### Team members

A team's home page also lists all team members sorted by their
[account's](/administer/accounts-teams) email address. The list
indicates accounts with administrative access by listing **Admin** with their email
address. Service accounts have an email address consisting of its
slug followed by `@serviceaccount.chronosphere.io`.

## Edit a home page

Each home page generates its content based on its team's or collection's associations
with other resources. To update those associations, see the documentation for those
resources.

### Teams

To edit a team's name, description, or membership, see [Teams](/administer/accounts-teams/teams).
