title: Agent image type
'og:description': Choose the image type for your pipeline agent in Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline.

{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


One [component](/pipelines/core-components) of Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline
is the agent that powers each pipeline. Chronosphere maintains two different versions
of this agent that are built from distinct container images. You can set the image type for this
pipeline agent when you [create](/pipeline-data/create-modify#create-a-pipeline)
a new pipeline, or change the image type when you [upgrade](/pipeline-install/upgrade#upgrade-a-pipeline)
an existing pipeline.

The agent image that you choose doesn't affect the features available to that
pipeline. All [plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins), [parsers](/pipeline-data/parsers),
[processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules), and
[configuration options](/pipeline-configure) are compatible with all agent image types.

The following pipeline agent image types are available:

- Red Hat UBI (default)
- Distroless

## Red Hat UBI

The Red Hat UBI pipeline agent is based on the
[Red Hat Universal Base Image](https://catalog.redhat.com/en/software/base-images),
which is itself based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
This is the default agent image in Telemetry Pipeline.

Pipelines that use the Red Hat UBI agent image have access to several utilities
bundled with the Red Hat-supplied container image, including debugging
tools, which makes this agent image ideal for development environments. However,
the Red Hat UBI agent image has more package dependencies than the distroless agent
image, which means it might not be suitable in environments with strict security
requirements.

## Distroless

The distroless pipeline agent is based on the
[distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
container image published by Google, which is itself based on Debian.

The distroless agent image has fewer package dependencies than the Red Hat UBI
agent image, which reduces the risk of underlying security vulnerabilities and
makes it ideal for production environments. However, pipelines that use the
distroless agent image are harder to debug than pipelines that use the Red Hat
UBI agent image.
