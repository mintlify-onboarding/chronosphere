Telemetry Pipeline saves a history of each pipeline's configuration settings
and statuses over time.

## View configuration history

To view the configuration history for a specific pipeline, use the following
command:

```shell copy
calyptia get pipeline_config_history --pipeline PIPELINE_ID
```

Replace _`PIPELINE_ID`_ with the [pipeline ID](/pipeline-configure/metadata#get-pipeline-ids)
of your pipeline.

This command returns a list of configuration IDs that correspond to different
snapshots from that pipeline's configuration history. Its output
will be similar to the following:

```text
 ID                                    AGE
 7c636cb9-2734-4168-81e3-3a84208049ae  36 seconds
 1542066b-c2ff-4908-bd81-4d815f9ae22a  1 minute
 7a3d0d8d-2e7a-4443-b5be-11b86942499c  5 minutes
 237e3f6f-52e9-4dea-a7da-070a58bf4884  15 hours
```

### Limit results

Use the `--last` flag to display only a subset of configuration snapshots. For example, to
return a list of the last five snapshots, run:

```shell copy
calyptia get pipeline_config_history --pipeline my-pipeline --last 5
```

### View specific changes

Use the `-o yaml` flag to view the specific changes over time to that
pipeline's [configuration file](/pipeline-configure/config-files):

```shell copy
calyptia get pipeline_config_history --pipeline my-pipeline -o yaml
```

## Roll back pipeline configuration history

<Warning>
If you used the `--skip-config-validation` flag when you created or modified
a pipeline, you must also include that flag when you run the `rollout` command
for that pipeline.
</Warning>

To roll back a pipeline to a previous configuration, use the following command:

```shell copy
calyptia rollout pipeline PIPELINE_ID --to-config-id CONFIG_ID
```

Replace the following:

- _`PIPELINE_ID`_: The [pipeline ID](/pipeline-configure/metadata#get-pipeline-ids)
  of your pipeline.
- _`CONFIG_ID`_: The [configuration ID](#view-configuration-history)
  you want to roll your pipeline back to.

### Roll back a specific number of steps

In addition to using the history ID of a previous configuration, you can also
specify the number of steps you want to roll back through the configuration history
of a pipeline. To do so, use the following command:

```shell copy
calyptia rollout pipeline PIPELINE_ID --steps-back COUNT
```

Replace the following:

- _`PIPELINE_ID`_: The [pipeline ID](/pipeline-configure/metadata#get-pipeline-ids)
  of your pipeline.
- _`COUNT`_: The number of steps to roll back through the pipeline's configuration
  history. This must be an integer value.

## View status history

To view the status history for a specific pipeline, use one of these methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web interface" id="status-ui">

{/* markdownlint-disable MD013 */}

1. Sign in to [Telemetry Pipeline](https://core.calyptia.com/).
1. Open the project that contains the pipeline whose status you want to view.
1. Go to **Core Instances**, then click the name of the Core Instance associated
   with the pipeline whose status you want to view.
1. Under **Data Pipelines**, find the pipeline whose status you want to view, and
   then click **<Icon icon="gear" />Settings&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> <Icon icon="clock-rotate-left" />Status History**.

{/* markdownlint-enable MD013 */}

The pane that appears shows a list of statuses changes over time for that pipeline.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="status-cli">

Run the following [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli) command:

```shell copy
calyptia get pipeline_status_history --pipeline PIPELINE_ID
```

Replace _`PIPELINE_ID`_ with the [pipeline ID](/pipeline-configure/metadata#get-pipeline-ids)
of your pipeline.

This command returns a list of statuses and corresponding configuration
IDs over time for that pipeline. Its output will be similar to the following:

```text
 STATUS   CONFIG ID                             AGE
 STARTED  237e3f6f-52e9-4dea-a7da-070a58bf4884  15 hours
 NEW      237e3f6f-52e9-4dea-a7da-070a58bf4884  15 hours
```

</Tab>
