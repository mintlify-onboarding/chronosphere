You can customize dashboard features to suit your data visualization needs.

_[Layouts](/observe/dashboards/customization/layouts)_ help you organize
related [panels](/observe/dashboards/panels) into panel groups.

_[Time ranges](/observe/dashboards/customization/time-ranges)_ focus panel visualizations
onto specific periods to aid in correlating anomalies in data across different series
and measurements, and also help you compare data from one period against other periods
in the past.

_[Dashboard variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables)_ let
users dynamically redefine parts of panel queries and other features by selecting
values from a dropdown or entering them into a field.
