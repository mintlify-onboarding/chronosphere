Glob patterns specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters. The most common
wildcards are `*`, `?`, and `[…]`. You can negate any pattern by prefixing it with a
`!`.

<Info>
Observability Platform glob syntax doesn't support using two asterisks where one of
them is in the middle of a string. For example, `*k8s*staging` isn't valid.
