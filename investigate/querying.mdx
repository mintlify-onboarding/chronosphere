After [ingesting](/ingest) your telemetry data into Observability Platform, you can
query that data to surface information when you need it. This capability is
especially useful during incident response when you're trying to identify the source
of an issue.

How you query telemetry data in Observability Platform depends on the data type. Use
these resources to learn how to query your data:

- [Search logs](/investigate/querying/query-logs)
- [Search metrics](/investigate/querying/metrics)
- [Search traces](/investigate/querying/traces)
- [Filter events](/investigate/querying/filter-events)

To visualize the results of queries,
[add queries to dashboards](/investigate/querying/dashboard-query)
from supported Explorers. You can also [create links](/investigate/querying/create-links)
between telemetry types, such as linking to trace or log data from dashboards.

Learn about using [regular expressions](/investigate/querying/regular-expressions)
and [glob syntax](/investigate/querying) in queries, including where they're
supported and how they differ.

If you're querying metric data, learn about
[Using PromQL in Observability Platform](/investigate/querying/promql), including the
most relevant features and syntax.
