You can route log data from Logstash to Chronosphere Observability Platform. To route
logs, configure an
[HTTP output plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-http.html)
in your
[Logstash pipeline configuration file](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/config-setting-files.html)
that specifies your Observability Platform tenant as a destination.

1. In your Logstash pipeline configuration file, add an `output` section that defines
   the `http` plugin:

   ```text copy
   output {
     http {
        http_method=>"post"
        headers => {
            "Content-Type" => "application/json"
            "API-token" => "API_TOKEN"
        }
        url=>"https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/api/v1/data/logs/ingest"
        format=>"json_batch"
     }
   }
   ```

   - Replace _`API_TOKEN`_ with the API token generated from your
     [service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts). Chronosphere
     recommends storing your API token in a separate file or Kubernetes Secret and
     calling it using an environment variable, such as `$API_TOKEN`.
   - Replace _`TENANT`_ with your organization name, prefixed to your Observability
     Platform instance. For example, _`MY_ORGANIZATION`_`.chronosphere.io`.
   - Optional: The `format=>"json_batch"` option collects each batch of events
     received by the output and places them into a single JSON array that's sent in
     one request.

1. After defining the output, [contact Chronosphere Support](/support) and indicate
   which field in your data contains log timestamps.
