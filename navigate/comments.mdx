Metric data provides insights that users can add to queries and dashboards to better
understand their system, especially when investigating issues. To make sense of these
metrics, users often need to consult with experts in their organization, or spend
time sifting through heaps of data to identify which metrics and labels have high
utility.

To provide additional context about open source metrics like Prometheus and
OpenTelemetry metrics, use _comments_. This capability lets you annotate metrics with
information to signify importance, help other users to understand usage context, and
turn informal knowledge into institutional knowledge that can be used across your
organization.

You can add comments to metrics in any of the locations within Observability Platform
mentioned on this page. Comments, and responses to comments, persist until the
comments are deleted. This behavior applies to metrics impacted by
[drop rules](/control/shaping/rules/drop-rules) and
[rollup rules](/control/shaping/rules/rollup), and comments on metrics and labels
that were removed from queries.

## View comments

You can view a list of recent comments from your [personal home page](/observe/personal-homepage),
and view specific comments in context of the Chronosphere entity that they're attached to.

### View recent comments

To view recent comments, use the
[**Recent comments** panel](/observe/personal-homepage#recent-comments) on your personal
home page.

### View contextual comments

Chronosphere entities that have comments display a **<Icon icon="message" /> message**
icon with a number that indicates how many comments were added.
