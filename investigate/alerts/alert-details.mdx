Chronosphere Observability Platform generates detailed visualizations of each triggered
alert, and provides tools to help you analyze when, why, and how the alert was triggered.

You can access alert detail pages wherever a triggered alert is referenced, including:

- From the [list of alerts](/investigate/alerts/alerts-list), which you can access
  by selecting **<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerting <span aria-label="and then">></span> Alerts**
  in the navigation menu.
- From the source entity, such as the [monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors) or
  [service level objective (SLO)](/observe/slo), that defined the alert's triggers

## View an alert's details

Each alert presents its **alert details** in a section that includes the alert's
status, a visualization of the queries that triggered the alert and any change events,
and a table of the series and conditions that triggered the alert and serve as a
legend for the chart.

The page designates the alert's status with an icon, text, and color:

| Icon | Text | Description |
| ---- | ---- |------------ |
| <Icon icon="hexagon-exclamation" style={{ color: 'rgb(238, 108, 108)' }}/> | **Critical** | Actively triggered alert that exceeds the defined critical conditions. |
| <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" style={{ color: 'rgb(255, 178, 73)' }}/>    | **Warning**  | Actively triggered alert that exceeds the defined warning conditions.  |
| <Icon icon="bell-slash" style={{ color: 'rgb(193, 166, 248)' }}/>   | **Muted**    | Alert that's muted by an active muting rule.                           |
| <Icon icon="circle-check" style={{ color: 'rgb(89, 204, 141)' }}/>    | **Passing**  | An alert that's no longer triggered.                                   |

The page also lists any triggering **[Signal](/investigate/alerts/notifications/signals)** as chips
that identify its keys and their values.

The **query results** that triggered the alert are visualized as a
[time series chart](/observe/dashboards/panels/time-series-chart). You can optionally:

- **Show thresholds**, which draws dotted horizontal lines on the time series chart
  depicting the alert's triggering thresholds
- **Show query**, which displays the query that triggered the alert and populates
  the time series chart
- Perform [differential diagnosis](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis) (**DDx**)
  on the data
- **Open in explorer**, which opens [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics)
  and populates it with the triggering query

In the time series table that follows, you can select from visualized series to
highlight them in the visualization, and you can **search series** to filter the
list. You can also toggle between the default **<Icon icon="grid" /> table view**,
which lists the time series' status as an icon and its labels and their values,
or a **<Icon icon="list" /> list view** that lists only each series'
status and the query that produces it.

You can optionally reveal the **Conditions** that triggered the alert, which
Observability Platform lists as a table of each condition's status, operator, sustained duration,
time to resolution, and the signals to which the alert's conditions apply.

### SLO panels

If the alert's source is an SLO, the alert details page also reproduces the SLO's
**SLI breakdown** and **Burn/Error rates** sections for reference. For more information,
see [Service level objectives](/observe/slo).

## Mute an alert

To mute an alert, create a [muting rule](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules). You can do this
directly from an alert details page by clicking the **<Icon icon="clock-rotate-left" /> Mute alert**
button. This opens a panel to [create a muting rule](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules#create-a-muting-rule)
that's populated with the alert's relevant source and name, and without requiring
you to leave the alert details page.

If a muting rule is already muting a triggered alert, clicking this button instead
opens a panel to edit the associated muting rule.

Alternatively, you can select
**<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerting <span aria-label="and then">></span> Muting Rules**
in the navigation menu to create new muting rules or edit existing muting rules.
However, doing so doesn't populate the muting rule with details from a specific
alert's source.

## Navigate to an alert's source

Each alert detail page includes a link to return to the source of its trigger.
For instance, an alert triggered by a monitor has a **Return to source monitor** link,
and an alert triggered by an SLO has a **Return to source SLO** link.

If you navigate to an alert's source, you can return to the alert either by clicking
the triggered alert in the source entity, or by navigating to the
[list of alerts](/investigate/alerts/alerts-list) and filtering it by the alert's
title.

## Define the alert detail view's time range

You can customize the chronological scope of an alert's details by selecting a
[time range](/navigate/time-ranges), which defaults to the **Last 1 hour**. The
chart and time series table update to depict time series data only within the selected
time range, but the alert's status always displays its current state.

<Warning>
Selecting a time span that lacks data related to the alert can cause the alert's
tables or visualizations to report **No data**. Confirm that the time range selector
is set to a range relevant to the alerting event.
</Warning>

## Perform differential diagnosis (DDx) on an alert

You can also use [differential diagnosis (DDx)](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis)
from an alert's detail page. This helps you identify correlations within specific
alerts while investigating the root causes of their triggers.

## Examine an alert's related change events

If you've [enabled change events](/observe/enable-events), the alert details page
displays associated events in the time series chart and lists them in the **Change events**
section.

To toggle or filter change events in the chart, click **<Icon icon="layer-group" /> Events**
to open the **Display events** panel. Toggle their **Status**, **Events list**,
and **Categories** to your preferences, and then click **Save** to confirm your
changes.

The change events list includes each [Alert change event](/overview/concepts/change-events)
related to the displayed alert. The section's table lists events that occurred during
the selected time span in chronological order, starting with the most recent event.

To view a change event's details, click the event's row in the list to open its
**Change event** panel. This displays the event's title, category, source, type,
time of occurrence, and label names and values. It also links to the alert's source
and provides tabs to **Comments** and the change event entity's **JSON** depiction.

To further explore all of the listed change events, click **Open explorer** in the
alert details page's **Change events** section to open
[Changes Explorer](/overview/concepts/change-events) and populate it with the same
time range and query used to populate the alert details page's list of change events.

## View an alert's related information

The **Alert information** sidebar identifies the [collection](/administer/collections)
identified as the alert's **Owner** and its associated **[Team](/administer/accounts-teams/teams)**.
If the alert's source is an SLO, this section also lists the SLO's **Runbook** link
if one is defined.

When designing collections and teams, add useful links, details, and default notification policies
to ensure that responders can quickly identify and notify responsible colleagues
or follow established policies and processes when an alert is triggered.

The **Additional information** section of the sidebar lists any **Annotations**
defined on the alert's triggering source. For example, if you defined
[annotations](/investigate/alerts/monitors#annotations) on a monitor, the alert's
additional information lists each of the monitor's annotations and populates any
variables defined in them.

When designing something that can trigger an alert, such as a monitor or SLO, use
annotations to conditionally contextualize these alert views with information pertinent
to responders.

## Analyze alert patterns

The sidebar provides links to
**[analyze alert patterns](/investigate/alerts/alert-details/alert-patterns)**
through a heatmap visualization and a table of associated alerts. You can analyze
patterns by time range or by other alerts triggered by the same source, such as
a [monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors) or [service level objective (SLO)](/observe/slo).

### Analyze patterns by time range

The **Related alerts** sidebar section provides a count of all other alerts triggered
during the same time range. It also provides a link to open the **Analyze alert patterns**
panel, which provides a heatmap visualization of those alerts.

### Analyze patterns by source

An additional sidebar section identifies any other alerting signals triggered by
the same source. For example, if the source is a monitor, the section is titled
**Alerting signals in this monitor**.

This section also provides a link to open the **Analyze alert patterns** panel
which the selected alert depicted with others triggered by the same source.
