<PipelineFlow/>

Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline provides _plugins_ that let you route telemetry
data from one or more sources to one or more destinations. Plugins
are customizable and offer support for logs, metrics, and traces, although not
all plugins support all telemetry types.

[Source plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins) ingest data into your
pipelines, and [destination plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins)
send that data to the storage or analysis platform of your choice.

## Add plugins to a pipeline

The source and destination plugins for each pipeline are listed in the `inputs`
and `outputs` section of that pipeline's [configuration file](/pipeline-configure/config-files).

To add plugins to a pipeline, you can either edit a pipeline through the
Telemetry Pipeline web interface, or edit the pipeline's configuration file
directly. Each plugin includes a number of customizable settings, which are
represented as key/value pairs within a configuration file. Many of these
settings have default values.

For example, this snippet shows the default configuration settings for an
[OpenTelemetry source plugin](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins/opentelemetry):

```yaml
pipeline:
  inputs:
    - Name: opentelemetry
      port: "8088"
      tag_from_uri: "false"
      buffer_chunk_size: 512K
      buffer_max_size: 4M
      successful_response_code: "201"
      tls.verify: on
      tls.debug: "1"
<...>
```

### Descriptive names

To help keep track of your plugins, Telemetry Pipeline lets you add custom metadata
to each plugin, including descriptive names. These descriptive names don't overwrite
the default names assigned to each plugin. Instead, they're displayed under the
plugin's default name in the Telemetry Pipeline web interface.

To add a descriptive name to a plugin through the Telemetry Pipeline web interface:

1. In the **Pipeline Builder**, click the existing plugin to edit it.
1. Expand the **Metadata** section, and enter a value in the **Name** field.
1. Click **Save**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Configuration file" id="yaml">

To add a descriptive name to a plugin by editing a
[pipeline configuration file](/pipeline-configure/config-files):

- Add the following lines of YAML to the entry for that plugin:

   ```yaml
         core.metadata:
         name: NAME
   ```

   Replace _`NAME`_ with the descriptive name you want to use for the plugin.

The `core.metadata` key must be nested at the same level as other top-level
configuration keys, and must _not_ replace the default `Name` key. For example,
this snippet shows an OpenTelemetry source plugin correctly configured to use
a descriptive name:

```yaml
pipeline:
  inputs:
    - Name: opentelemetry
      port: "8088"
      core.metadata:
        name: otel-instance-1
<...>
```
