The Chronosphere Collector can either collect metrics data or receive trace data.
When collecting metrics data, the Collector _pulls_ data it scrapes from Prometheus
endpoints. When receiving trace data, an app _pushes_ data to a service, with the
Collector behind that service receiving the data.

Regardless of the installation method you use, Chronosphere recommends deploying
separate, independent Collectors for metrics and for traces. This distinction means
that a Collector either collects metrics data or receives trace data.

## Collect metrics data

You can install the Collector to retrieve metrics data, either with Kubernetes or as
a standalone binary. When deployed within Kubernetes, the Collector scrapes
Prometheus endpoints exposed on pods, based on pod-level annotations.

### With Kubernetes

You can install the Collector with Kubernetes to collect metrics as:

- [A Kubernetes DaemonSet](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/install/kubernetes) (recommended)
- [A Deployment](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/install/kubernetes#install-the-collector-using-a-deployment)
- [A sidecar](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/install/kubernetes#install-the-collector-as-a-sidecar)

Chronosphere recommends installing the Collector as a Kubernetes DaemonSet on each
node in a cluster to:

- Minimize cross-node network traffic within a cluster.
- Eliminate a single point of failure in case one node is offline.
- Provide the ability to switch to a standalone deployment if the Collector is
  using too many resources.

### Without Kubernetes

If you don't use Kubernetes, or want to gather metrics from services not managed by
Kubernetes, you can install the Collector
[as a standalone binary](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/install/standalone).

<Info>
Docker images for versions `0.93.0` and later are `multiplatform` builds for both
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Chronosphere also offers
[Linux binaries](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/install/standalone#download-the-collector-binary-and-make-it-executable)
for both of these platforms.

## Receive trace data

To receive trace data, Chronosphere recommends
[installing the Collector](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/install/tracing) as a Kubernetes
Deployment, typically with a service in front to receive trace data. Your tracing app
pushes trace data to the service, which the Collector receives the data from.
