[Change events](/overview/concepts/change-events) provide an additional layer of
meaning to your telemetry data. Use the following documentation to learn about how to
interact with change events in Chronosphere Observability Platform.

## Ingest

Observability Platform supports ingesting third-party events, which display as change
events within Changes Explorer, and as change events on dashboards, traces, and
services, and query results for monitors.

## Filter

Learn how to filter change events in Changes Explorer to narrow your search focus and
identify changes that matter when you're trying to understand the root cause of an
issue.

## Observe

On-call engineers can enable and overlay change events on panels in Observability
Platform to provide additional context that helps correlate events with system and
service anomalies, allowing for quicker identification of incident cause.
