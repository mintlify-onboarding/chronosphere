
Chronosphere Observability Platform imports, exports, and updates dashboards as JSON
representations, which you can submit to Observability Platform as an inline string value in
the [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) YAML representation of a dashboard resource.

For details about creating and updating dashboard JSON in Chronoctl YAML, see
[Create a dashboard](/observe/dashboards#create-a-dashboard). For details about the panel
JSON representation format, see
[JSON representation](/observe/dashboards/panels/json-representation).
