Chronosphere Observability Platform supports two
[Collectors](#chronosphere-collector-or-opentelemetry-collector) to ingest metric
and trace data, the Chronosphere Collector and the OpenTelemetry Collector.
Observability Platform also supports direct metric imports from
[Google Cloud](#google-cloud).

## Chronosphere Collector or OpenTelemetry Collector

Your Collector selection depends on the telemetry data you plan to ingest.

Chronosphere recommends using the vendor-supported, optimized, and highly performant
[Chronosphere Collector](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector) for Prometheus discovery and scrape
workloads. This use case typically works best with metrics data.

Use the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/ingest/metrics-traces/otel/) if your organization uses
OpenTelemetry SDKs for app instrumentation. An added benefit of using the
OpenTelemetry Collector is you can configure dynamic, remotely configurable
[head sampling](/control/sampling/head-sampling), which is a powerful control
mechanism for managing your tracing costs. Observability Platform supports the
[OpenTelemetry JaegerRemoteSampler](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#jaegerremotesampler)
head sampling standard for remotely controlling the sampling configuration of
OpenTelemetry SDKs.

Chronosphere doesn't provide customer support for OpenTelemetry components.

## Google Cloud

Observability Platform can import metrics data directly from
[Google Cloud](/ingest/metrics-traces/gcp). Google Cloud metrics map closely to the
default Prometheus metrics that Observability Platform uses.

## Amazon Web Services

Observability Platform supports receiving CloudWatch metrics through
[CloudWatch Metrics Streams](/ingest/metrics-traces/aws-cloudwatch-metric-stream).
You can configure Amazon Web Services (AWS) to continually stream metrics to
Observability Platform by configuring CloudWatch Metric Streams, either manually in
the AWS Management Console or by using Terraform.
