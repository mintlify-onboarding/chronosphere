## Uninstall from a Kubernetes cluster

To uninstall Telemetry Pipeline from a Kubernetes cluster, use one of the following
methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="cli-uninstall">

To uninstall Telemetry Pipeline from a Kubernetes cluster using Pipeline CLI:

1. [Delete](/pipeline-data/create-modify#delete-a-pipeline) any active pipelines.

1. In [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli), run the following command to verify you
   successfully deleted all pipelines:

   ```shell copy /INSTANCE/
   calyptia get pipelines --core-instance INSTANCE --show-ids
   ```

   Replace _`INSTANCE`_ with the name of your Core Instance.

1. Run the following command to delete your Core Instance:

   ```shell copy /INSTANCE/
   calyptia delete core_instance operator INSTANCE
   ```

   Replace _`INSTANCE`_ with the name of your Core Instance.

1. Run the following command to uninstall your Core Operator:

   ```shell copy
   calyptia uninstall operator
   ```

1. Optional: Delete the namespace where you installed Telemetry Pipeline. This
   ensures no stray Telemetry Pipeline resources persist in your cluster. To do
   so, run the following `kubectl` command:

   ```shell copy /NAMESPACE/
   kubectl delete namespace NAMESPACE
   ```

   Replace _`NAMESPACE`_ with the namespace where you installed Telemetry Pipeline.
   If you didn't specify a namespace during your Telemetry Pipeline installation,
   it was installed in the `calyptia` namespace.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Helm" id="helm-uninstall">

To uninstall Telemetry Pipeline from a Kubernetes cluster using Helm:

1. [Delete](/pipeline-data/create-modify#delete-a-pipeline) any active pipelines.

1. Run the following command to determine which Helm charts are installed in your
   cluster:

   ```shell copy
   helm list -n NAMESPACE
   ```

   Replace _`NAMESPACE`_ with the namespace where you installed Telemetry Pipeline.

1. Run the following command to uninstall your Core Instance:

   ```shell copy /NAME/ /NAMESPACE/
   helm uninstall NAME -n NAMESPACE
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`NAME`_: The name of your Core Instance, as displayed by
   the output of the previous step.
   - _`NAMESPACE`_: The namespace where you installed Telemetry Pipeline. If you
   didn't specify a namespace during your Telemetry Pipeline installation, it
   was installed in the `calyptia` namespace.

1. Run the following command to uninstall the CRDs for Telemetry Pipeline:

   ```shell copy
   helm uninstall core-crd
   ```

1. Run the following command to uninstall your Core Operator:

   ```shell copy /NAMESPACE/
   helm uninstall core-operator -n NAMESPACE
   ```

   Replace _`NAMESPACE`_ with the namespace where you installed Telemetry Pipeline.

1. Run the following command to verify that the uninstall commands removed
   all Helm charts for Telemetry Pipeline:

   ```shell copy
   helm list -n NAMESPACE
   ```

   Replace _`NAMESPACE`_ with the namespace where you installed Telemetry Pipeline.
