Deployment strategies govern how a pipeline's [replicas](/pipeline-configure/scaling)
behave during the [upgrade](/pipeline-install/upgrade) process. Chronosphere
Telemetry Pipeline offers these deployment strategies:

- **Rolling Update**: Default. Individually upgrades and restarts each replica of
  a pipeline. This ensures that at least one replica is always running, which
  lets telemetry data continue to flow without interruption. If a pipeline has
  only one replica, this strategy creates a new, upgraded replica, and then destroys
  the old replica.
- **Hot Reload**: Upgrades all of a pipeline's replicas simultaneously
  without restarting any of them. During this upgrade process, pipelines continue
  to run and they attempt to maintain the flow of telemetry data.

## Modify a pipeline's deployment strategy

Use one of these methods to modify a pipeline's deployment strategy.

<Tab title="Web interface" id="strategy-ui">

1. Sign in to [Telemetry Pipeline](https://core.calyptia.com/).
1. Open the project that contains the pipeline whose deployment strategy you want
   to modify.
1. Go to **Core Instances**, and then click the name of the Core Instance associated
   with the pipeline whose deployment strategy you want to modify.
1. In the **Data Pipelines** section, click the name of the pipeline whose deployment strategy
   you want to modify.
1. Click <Icon icon="square-pen" />&nbsp;**Advanced Settings**.
1. In the **Deployment Strategy** section, select either **Rolling Update** or **Hot Reload**.
1. To save your changes, click **Update**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="strategy-cli">

In [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli), run the following command:

```shell /PIPELINE/ /OPTION/
calyptia update pipeline PIPELINE --deployment-strategy OPTION
```

Replace the following:

- _`PIPELINE`_: The name or [unique ID](/pipeline-configure/metadata#get-pipeline-ids)
  of your pipeline.
- _`OPTION`_: The deployment strategy to use for that pipeline. Possible values
  are `rollingupdate` and `hotReload`.
