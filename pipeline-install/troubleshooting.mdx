{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


As part of the installation process, Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline performs
[health checks](/pipeline-install/install-operator/linux#health-checks) on your behalf.
If you encounter any issues when trying to install Telemetry Pipeline, Chronosphere
recommends taking the following troubleshooting steps.

{/* vale Chronosphere.Units = NO */}

1. Check for any warnings or errors in the output of the health checks
   that Telemetry Pipeline ran on your behalf.

1. Confirm that you've met the
   [networking and OS requirements](/pipeline-install/prereqs)
   for Telemetry Pipeline.

1. Confirm that you've met the
   [K3s requirements](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements).

1. Run the following command to disable FIPS mode, and then reboot:

   ```shell
   fips-mode-setup --disable
   ```

1. Run the following command to disable your firewall:

   <Tabs>
   <Tab title="RHEL">

      ```shell
      systemctl disable firewalld --now
      ```

   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Ubuntu">

      ```shell
      ufw disable
      ```

   </Tab>
   </Tabs>

1. Verify that SELinux is either disabled or in permissive (not enforcing) mode.

1. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux only, verify that your cryptographic policy is set to
   either `default` or `legacy`.

1. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux only, run the following command to disable
   `nm-cloud-setup`, then reboot the node:

   ```shell
   systemctl disable nm-cloud-setup.service nm-cloud-setup.timer
   reboot
   ```

1. Examine the following K3s network ranges to ensure they aren't conflicting
   with your network settings:

   - Pods are allocated in the CIDR range `10.42.0.0/16`. Use the
     `INSTALL_CALYPTIA_CLUSTER_CIDR` environment variable to override.
   - Services are allocated in the CIDR range `10.43.0.0/16`. Use the
     `INSTALL_CALYPTIA_SERVICE_CIDR` environment variable to override.
   - Cluster DNS is set to `10.43.0.10`. Use the `INSTALL_CALYPTIA_CLUSTER_DNS`
     environment variable to override.
   - The cluster domain suffix is set to `cluster.local`. Use the
     `INSTALL_CALYPTIA_CLUSTER_DOMAIN` environment variable to override.
   - Node ports are allocated in the range `30000` to `32767`. Use the
     `INSTALL_CALYPTIA_SERVICE_NODE_PORT_RANGE` environment variable to override
     during installation.

1. Examine your local `/etc/resolv.conf` configuration to ensure it isn't using
   a DNS server or specifying any override that might conflict with K3s.
