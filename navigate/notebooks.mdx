Use _notebooks_ to gather information from multiple pages in Chronosphere Observability
Platform. When you're troubleshooting a problem, you might need graphs, charts, and
other resources to review at the same time. Notebooks let you gather these resources
in one place for ease of review.

Your notebook isn't visible to other users.

## View your notebook

Your notebook is visible anywhere in Observability Platform.

To open your notebook, click the **Notebook** <img src="/doc-assets/notebook.png"
alt="Notebook icon" /> icon in the right sidebar, or use the keyboard shortcut
`Command+I` (on macOS).

## Add items to your notebook

You can add items from several Observability Platform pages to your notebook.
To do so:

1. In a supported resource, select the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />three vertical
   dots icon.
1. Select **Add to notebook**.

The selected resource displays at the bottom of your notebook.

To delete an item from your notebook, click the item and then press `Delete`.

Notebooks support text anywhere in your notebook that isn't an added element.
Notebook text supports a limited set of [markdown functions](https://commonmark.org/help/).
Some formatting options are available in the toolbar under the **Notebook** title bar.

## Customize panels in a notebook

You can change the [time range](/navigate/time-ranges) for the entire notebook, or
on a per-panel basis. Use this to compare different times for multiple copies of the
same panel. For example, if there's an anomaly in a graph in your notebook, add a
second copy, and change the time range to the same time last week to compare
patterns.

To customize a panel's time range:

1. Hold the pointer over the panel.
1. Click the <Icon icon="clock" /> clock icon.
1. Select an available time range, or **Custom time range** to set your own.

The customized time range displays in the panel next to the panel name, or
**Custom time range** if you selected your own.

To reset the time range, click the <Icon icon="clock" /> clock icon and
select **Use Notebook Time**.

### Resources available to notebooks

In general, resources that look like dashboard panels can be added to a notebook.
These panels are available on various pages throughout Observability Platform.

You can add the following resources to notebooks:

- [Dashboard panels](/observe/dashboards/panels)
- Query results in [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer)
- Panels in the [License overview](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#license-overview)
- [SLO charts](/observe/slo)
- [Service panels](/observe/services/service-pages#visualization-panels)
- Query results in [Metrics DDx](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/metrics)
- [Tracing data](/control/sampling/)
- Query results in [Logs Explorer](/investigate/querying/query-logs)
- Graphs in the [Metrics catalog](/investigate/querying/metrics/metrics-catalog) preview

## Delete your notebook contents

To clear the entire notebook, click the **<Icon icon="trash" />
Trash** icon.
