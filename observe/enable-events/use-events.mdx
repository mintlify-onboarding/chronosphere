Use change events to understand what changed and help investigate and remediate
issues when they arise. You can [create change events](#create-change-events) that
don't already exist in Chronosphere Observability Platform.

You can also [enable change events](/observe/enable-events/dashboards) on standard
and classic dashboards by configuring an annotation with a change events query.

## View change events

Select from the following methods to view change events.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="view-change-events-cloud">

To view change events:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Changes Explorer**.

1. Click a change event in the results list to display its
   [full details](#change-event-details).

1. Use the query box to
   [filter change events](/investigate/querying/filter-events) to locate where
   and when an issue occurred.

   In the left navigation, expand **Quick filters**.
1. Click any filter to run a predefined filter.
   - **Code deploys** returns all deploy change events that started or ended,
     including any feature flag changes.
   - **Triggered alerts** returns all alert change events where a monitor triggered.
   - Other quick filters are defined by [users with SysAdmin](/investigate/querying/filter-events#save-a-filter)
     privileges and will depend on how the filter is defined.
1. As you refine your query, click and select a portion of the time chart to zoom in
   to a shorter time window.

### Change event details

Click a specific change event to view all of its available details in a tabbed interface.

#### Summary

The **Summary** tab includes an expanded view of the information from the main view,
such as all labels associated with the change event. You can filter by label in this
view by typing any part of the key or value for a particular label. Observability
Platform automatically renders any links in the **Labels** section as hyperlinks,
such as links to third-party sources, runbooks, or logs in your cloud provider.

Click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />three dots menu in any label row to take
one of the following actions for the selected label:

- **Include in filter**
- **Exclude in filter**
- **Add field as column**
- **Copy key**
- **Copy value**

#### Comments

The **Comments** tab lets you view, add, and respond to
[comments](/navigate/comments) for the selected change event.

#### JSON

The **JSON** tab displays the JSON payload accompanying the selected change event.
Use this view to:

- Investigate issues with a change event.
- Share change event details with other on-call engineers.
- Include snippets in a runbook.
- Build an example for creating change events using the Chronosphere API.

Explore this data to find metadata you want to extract and promote to the `labels`
map, or data you need to remove from the `labels` map.

## Create change events

Observability Platform automatically categorizes and displays change events in
Changes Explorer to help on-call engineers understand what changed, which can
expedite root cause analysis. However, you might want to explicitly create a change
event, like a broadcast to inform other users of an upcoming outage, or a third-party
change event in addition to the predefined change event categories.

Select from the following methods to create change events. Follow these
[best practices](#best-practices) as guidelines.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="create-change-events-cloud">

To create change events with Observability Platform:

1. In the navigation menu select **Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Changes Explorer**.

1. On the Changes Explorer page, click **+ Create Event**.

1. In the **Create Custom Event** dialog, define your change event.

1. In the **Title** field, enter a descriptive, unique title for the change event.

1. Select a timestamp to associate with the change event. Event creation is limited
   to 7 days in the past and 7 days into the future from the current time.

1. Select the **Category** of change event, which is likely **broadcast** or
   **third_party**.

1. Select a **Source** for the change event, which defaults to **chronosphere_ui**.

1. Enter a **Type** that maps to the category you selected. For example, if you
   selected **broadcasts** as the category, you might enter **outage** as the event
   type.

1. Add event labels to associate with the change event as key/value pairs.
   Observability Platform requires the `user_email` and `user_id` keys, which you
   can't edit.

1. Click **Create** to create the change event.

Your event is viewable and searchable from Changes Explorer.

<Tab title="API" id="create-change-events-api">

To complete this action with the Chronosphere API, use the
[`CreateEvent`](https://docs.chronosphere.io/tooling/api-info/data_definition/operations/CreateEvent)
endpoint.

Refer to the [change event limits](/administer/limits-licensing/limits/event-limits) for the
limitations of this API.

<Note>
Change Event categories are case sensitive. Each of the categories that Chronosphere
[supports by default](/observe/enable-events/use-events#categorize-change-events-intentionally)
are lowercase and must be queried in all lowercase. For example,
`"category": "alerts"` is valid, but `"category": "Alerts"` is invalid.

Chronosphere Support can add and remove custom categories upon request. Because
categories are case sensitive, custom categories must be queried using the same case
they were created. For example, if you create an event called `INGEST`, any queries
in Changes Explorer must use `INGEST` in all uppercase as the category to query.

### Best practices

Use the following best practices when creating change events with Observability
Platform and the Chronosphere CreateEvent API.

#### Categorize change events intentionally

How you categorize change events matters. Use `category` values to organize your
change events. Chronosphere supports the following change event categories by
default:

<ChangeEventsList />

Chronosphere also supports custom change event categories. For example, you might
rotate your secrets often, which can cause unintended authentication issues for
users. To track those events, you might want to add a `secrets_change` category to
quickly filter matching events. To request adding or removing a custom change event
category in your tenant, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support).

#### Identify the source

The primary objective when sending change events to Observability Platform is to
maintain both high signal and low noise. Avoid sending low-value events that create
noise.

The `source` field lets you know where events are coming from at all times. Use
strings that help you identify the source instrumentation that's generating event
data to help you locate that data.

#### Improve quality with proper typing

Types differentiate change events within a category or source. For example, you might
have a source named `deployer` with a `deploys` category. You can use different types
within that combination of source and category, such as `deploy_start` and
`deploy_end` to identify when a deploy begins and ends. Types can help improve the
quality of audit log events, and enable on-call engineers to better group and
identify data anomalies at a given point in time.
