After creating, monitoring, and adjusting [budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting)
for your log data, you can use tools in Chronosphere Observability Platform to
transform, reshape, retain, or exclude data. Managing the data you persist can reduce
your overall consumption, provide predictability in generated log data, and result in
more performant queries when searching through logs.

To create structured logs from plaintext logs, and parse individual fields to
extract meaningful data without changing your instrumentation, use
[parsing](/control/consumption/shape-logs/parse-logs).

To drop entire logs, drop individual fields, or sample a percentage of your log data,
create [control rules](/control/consumption/shape-logs/control-logs). Use these rules
to act on your log data and make decisions before persisting the data to the database.
