'og:description': Learn about fleet management in Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline.
---
{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


Fleets in Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline let you manage all of your
[telemetry agents](/fleets/agent), including Fluent Bit and Core Agent, from a single,
centralized location. By grouping multiple agents under the banner of a unified
fleet, you can perform batch operations across an entire fleet, instead of
individually configuring dozens or hundreds of telemetry agents.

Some of the benefits of using fleets in Telemetry Pipeline are:

- Fleets streamline the process of managing telemetry agents deployed in
  different locations, machines, or environments.
- Because all agents within a fleet share the same configuration settings, you
  can maintain consistent behavior between a large number of agents and roll out
  changes accordingly.
- Updates are pulled from an HTTP endpoint rather than pushed directly to each
  agent, which gives you more control over your fleet's network settings and
  eliminates the need to open a hole in your firewall.
