title: SignalFx ingestion

{/* -- dri: Garrett Guillotte -- */}


You can configure the Collector to process SignalFx data points. The Collector serves
SignalFx traffic at the `/signalfx/v2/datapoint` HTTP endpoint from the
`listenAddress`, which defaults to `0.0.0.0:3030`. The `/v2/datapoint` suffix is the
default expected path appended by SignalFx client libraries.

This integration pattern assumes that you've instrumented your apps with a SignalFx
client library, such as the [golib](https://github.com/signalfx/golib) library for
Go.

For equivalent functions between SignalFx and PromQL, see the
[equivalent function list](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/mappings/signalfx).

## Configure SignalFx ingestion

1. Download this
   [annotated manifest](https://storage.googleapis.com/chronosphere-release/latest/kubernetes/chronocollector.yaml)
   as a starting point.

1. Enable SignalFx mode under the `push.signalFX.enabled` YAML collection in the
   Collector manifest.

   ```yaml
   push:
      signalFX:
          enabled: true
   ```

1. Modify additional configuration options under the `push.signalFX` YAML collection.
