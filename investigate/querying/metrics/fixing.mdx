There are several ways to improve slow queries and dashboards and avoid query
truncation.

Use the [Metrics Query Capacity Overview dashboard](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards#metrics-query-capacity-overview)
to find slow queries.

- **Use aggregation functions.**

  Use functions like `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, and `max()` to aggregate time series.
  Although the query fetches all the underlying metrics, it displays only the
  aggregated result.

- **Use aggregation rules to reduce the number of time series returned by queries.**

  [Rollup rules](/control/shaping/rules) can eliminate labels that aren't needed.
  [Drop rules](/control/shaping/rules/drop-rules) reduce data before it's stored.

  Query Accelerator automatically scans for slow dashboard aggregation queries and
  replaces them with pre-aggregated results to accelerate dashboard load times.

- **Narrow a query's scope by time or label.**

  Queries often return more time series than needed for analysis or visualization.

  For example, to improve performance and visualization usability when querying
  `http_requests_total`, you can split either `endpoint` or `status_code` into
  separate graphs.

  ```shell
  http_requests_total{status_code="2xx"}
  http_requests_total{status_code=~"3xx|4xx|5xx"}
  ```

- **Collapse unused dashboard rows.**

  Grafana can [define rows](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v7.5/dashboards/#rows).
  When you collapse a row, Grafana doesn't load the underlying graphs. Grafana saves
  each row's state and doesn't load graphs in a collapsed row until you expand it.
