[Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
let you attach custom metadata to Telemetry Pipeline resources. These annotations won't
affect Telemetry Pipeline's behavior.

<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="annotations-cli">

[Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli) lets you specify tolerations for new resources.
However, you can't use Pipeline CLI to add or modify tolerations for an existing
resource.

When you create a new resource, add the `--annotations` flag to your operation,
and include an annotations string.

The string that specifies your annotations must follow this syntax:

```
annotation1=value1,annotation2=value2
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Helm" id="annotations-helm">

Helm lets you add annotations to new resources, and add or modify annotations
for existing resources.

To do so, add the following key/value pair to your Helm chart:

```yaml
calyptiaAnnotations: STRING
```

Replace _`STRING`_ with the string that specifies your annotations.

The string that specifies your annotations must follow this syntax:

```
annotation1=value1,annotation2=value2
```

However, if you're using Helm through the command line, you must escape any
commas with a backslash (`\`) to prevent Helm from incorrectly splitting the
string into multiple values. For example,
`--set calyptiaAnnotations='annotation1=value1\,annotation2=value2'` is valid syntax.
