When choosing metric names and key/value pairs for labels, it's important to be consistent
throughout your organization. Consistent labels reduce confusion across teams.

A metric consists of a name and a set of labels, regardless of its
[metric type](/control/shaping/types).

```text
node_network_receive_bytes_total{hostname="host1",mode="system"}
```

The _name_ of a metric is a single word that uniquely identifies the metric. In this
example, the name is `node_network_receive_bytes_total`.

A _label_ is a key/value pairs that helps differentiate and give meaning to
metric names. In this example, the labels are `hostname="host1"` and `mode="system"`.

## Metric name

Use these guidelines to name your metrics:

<Info>
Metric names must follow [Prometheus name and label requirements](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/).
Metrics that do not meet these requirements can not be queried and are considered
invalid. Chronosphere rejects metrics that don't meet these definitions.
</Info>

- Select a metric name that describes a function of the system you're monitoring
  (for example, `node_memory_usage_bytes`). Be as concise as possible.
- Include a prefix for the metric name that's relevant to the domain the metric belongs
  to. For example, adding `http` to `http_request_duration_seconds` lets users know
  this metric belongs to the HTTP domain.
- Use suffixes to describe the unit in plural form. For example, the `seconds` in
  `http_request_duration_seconds`.
- Metric names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, or colons, based on the
  regular expression `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`.
- Reserve colons (`:`) in the name for calculated or aggregated metrics, such
  as those produced by rollup rules.
- Don't use underscores at the beginning of a metric name. Leading underscores are
  reserved for internal use.
- Periods (`.`) convert to underscores (`_`).

## Label names and values

Labels are a set of comma-separated key/value pairs, contained in curly braces. Labels
let you query and alert on these different fields.

Use labels to differentiate and give meaning to metric names. For example,
`http_requests_total` refers to the total number of HTTP requests, but isn't fully
descriptive. Using labels, you can break down the number of requests by `method`,
`status_code`, and `endpoint`. Here are some best practices and limitations:

- Label keys
  - Use label keys to add dimensions to your metric name. For example,
    `endpoint:/api/create_user` or `method:POST`).
  - Don't add unbounded, high-cardinality labels, such as UUIDs or timestamps.
  - Label keys can contain letters, numbers, underscores, or colons, based on the
    regular expression `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`.
  - Don't use underscores at the beginning of a label key. Leading underscores are
    reserved for internal use.
- Label values
  - Label values might contain any Unicode characters.
  - A label with an empty label value is equivalent to a label that doesn't exist.
  - You can use PromQL to filter and aggregate based on these dimensions. Changing
    any label value, including adding or removing a label, creates a new time series.
