title: Verify and monitor the Collector
---
{/* -- dri: Garrett Guillotte -- */}


To ensure the Collector is ingesting data, you can verify the Collector is
[scraping the intended metrics](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/monitor/verify-metrics) or
[receiving trace data](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/monitor/verify-traces) from your app.

You can also [monitor the Collector](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/monitor/monitor-collector)
to ensure that Chronosphere receives telemetry data from your instances. If the
Collector can't start or scrape metrics, you can
[troubleshoot metrics ingestion](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/monitor/monitor-collector#troubleshoot-metric-ingestion).
