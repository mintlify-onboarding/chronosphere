Null is a type of data destination that lets you discard your telemetry data without
writing it to any external storage or output destination. The Null
[destination plugin](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins) (name: `"null"`)
is a tool for testing or debugging purposes when you want to simulate a data
flow without actually writing data to disk or sending it to an external system.

With the Null destination plugin, you can configure your pipeline to discard any
telemetry data that passes through it, ensuring that the data isn't saved or
transmitted to any external system. This can be used for verifying the configuration
of your pipeline or for troubleshooting issues in your data processing workflow. The
Null destination plugin can help you avoid unnecessary data storage or network
traffic.
