Pie charts help you quickly view and compare a limited number of data segments by
category. A _pie chart panel_ visualizes data returned by a [query](/investigate/querying)
as mutually exclusive, relatively proportional segments of a total amount. Each
segment's size corresponds to the proportion of the result's whole.

To visualize large numbers of categories or categories that aren't mutually
exclusive, or when you need to compare exact numbers with precision, consider using
categorical [bar charts](/observe/dashboards/panels/bar-chart) instead.

To create a pie chart or learn more about the configuration options common
to all panels, see [Panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).

## Use a pie chart's tooltip

When you hold the pointer over a segment in a pie chart, Observability Platform
displays a tooltip that shows the segment's full label and value. If the segment
is aggregated, the tooltip lists the top 10 series within the aggregation.

## Pie chart queries

Pie charts use one or more
[queries](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-query) to retrieve data to
visualize. Pie charts use the following query **Options** to refine the
displayed information, depending on your **Datasource**:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Metrics (Prometheus)">

- <DashboardSeriesNaming />
- **Type**: The [PromQL query](/investigate/querying/promql#basic-querying)
  type: **Instant**, or **Range**.
<DashboardDownsampleTruncate />

</Tab>
<Tab title="Logs">

<DashboardSeriesNaming />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure a pie chart

You can configure a pie chart by [modifying its **Settings**](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).

Any changes you make in the panel's **Settings** tab are immediately reflected in
the **Preview** pane, but take effect only when you click **Apply** in the **Edit panel**
interface and then save the dashboard.

Observability Platform doesn't fully support directly editing a panel's JSON representation
and recommends configuring panels in the user interface. Use the JSON representation
only for managing your configuration as code with tools such as [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl)
and [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform).

To modify a pie chart's settings using its Settings tab:

1. [Edit the pie chart panel](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).
1. In the **Edit panel** interface, click the **Settings** tab.

### Modify a pie chart's legend

The **Legend** section in a pie series chart's **Settings** tab controls whether
to display a legend alongside the chart, and if so it also configures where and
how the legend is displayed.

- **Show**: Toggles whether to display the legend. Defaults to disabled.
- **Position**: Selects whether to display the legend at the **Bottom** or to the
  **Right** of the chart. Defaults to **Bottom**.
- **Mode**: Selects whether to display the legend as a **List** of categories with
  a color swatch associating it with a line or bar on the chart, or as a **Table**
  with a header row. Defaults to **List**.
- **Size**: Defines the legend's size relative to the chart as either **Small**
  or **Medium**. Defaults to **Small**.

### Modify a pie chart's visual representation

The **Visual** section in a pie chart's **Settings** tab controls how
Observability Platform visualizes the query's pie results in the chart.

- **Display**: Toggles whether to visualize the data as a filled (**Default**) or
  **Donut** chart.
- **Show series name**: Toggles whether the series name is displayed next to the
  segment.
- **Color Palette**: Determines the chart's color palette. The **Classic** palette
  uses six colors and prioritizes readability. The **Consistent** palette
  includes more colors and lets you assign a color to a series consistently across
  multiple panels. The **Status-neutral** palette excludes red, orange, and green
  to help distinguish between the chart's values and status indicators. Defaults to **Classic**.

### Modify a pie chart's other features

The **Options** section in a pie chart's **Settings** tab controls other features
related to the chart's labels and units.

- **Label format**: Determines whether a segment's value label should be depicted
  as a **Percent**, the raw **Value**, or **Both** at once.

  Percent and Value labels each have their own options, listed under the **Percent**
  and **Value** subsections.

  - For both Value and Percent labels, **Decimals** determines the maximum number
    of decimal places to render. The resulting decimal places might be fewer than
    the selected value because Observability Platform doesn't render trailing zeros
    in decimal places.

    For example, when **Decimals** is set to **2**, the panel renders the value
    `1.5` as **1.5**, the value `1.55` as **1.55**, and `1.555` as **1.56**.

    You can choose from **0** to **4** maximum decimal places, or **Max**, which
    displays up to 20 decimal places.
  - For Value labels, you can configure additional settings:
    - **Unit**: Defines the value's unit. Defaults to `Decimal`.
    - **Decimal**: Displays values using base 10 units. For example, Observability Platform
      renders a decimal value of `1000000` as `1M` when **Abbreviate** is enabled.
    - **Bytes**: Displays values using decimal multiple-byte units.
    - **Time**: Determines the [unit of time](/overview/concepts/time-units)
      that Observability Platform uses to interpret a numeric value.
    - **Percent**: Interprets the value as a percentile, representing 0% to 100% on
      a range of either 0.0 to 1.0 (**Percent (0.0-1.0)**) or 0 and 100 (**Percent (0-100)**).

      For example, Observability Platform renders a value of `1.0` in
      **Percent (0.0-1.0)** as `100%`, and in **Percent (0-100)** as `1%`.
    - **Abbreviate**: Toggles whether to abbreviate units. For example,
      if you enable Abbreviate, Observability Platform renders a value of `100000000`
      as `100M`. You can toggle this setting only if you set the Unit to `Decimal`
      or `Bytes`; `Time` units are always abbreviated and `Percent` values don't require
      it. Defaults to `true`.
    - **Aggregate when % is \<=**: Defines the percentile threshold at which the chart
      aggregates the smallest categories into a single segment. Categories with a
      percentile value smaller than this setting are consolidated into a single
      segment on the chart. Defaults to `3`.
