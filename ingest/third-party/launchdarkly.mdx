To send LaunchDarkly events to Chronosphere Observability Platform, create a webhook
within LaunchDarkly and include your API key to authenticate with Observability
Platform.

## Obtain an API token

Before sending events from LaunchDarkly, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) to
obtain an API token for use with authenticating your third-party app with
Observability Platform.

<EventsToken />

## Create a LaunchDarkly webhook

To send LaunchDarkly events to Observability Platform:

1. In LaunchDarkly, [create a webhook](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/connecting/webhooks#creating-a-webhook).
1. In the **URL** field, enter
   `https://ADDRESS/api/v1/data/events/receiver/launchdarkly`.

   Replace _`ADDRESS`_ with your company name prefixed to your Observability Platform
   instance that ends in `.chronosphere.io`. For example,
   _`MY_COMPANY`_`.chronosphere.io`.
1. Click **Sign this webhook** to define a secret, which ensures requests are
   generated by LaunchDarkly.
1. In the **Secret** field, enter the API token you obtained from Chronosphere
   Support.
1. Optional: Add a policy if you want to select and filter the events you send to
   Observability Platform.

   Chronosphere recommends setting the following `actions` in the LaunchDarkly
   advanced editor:

   ```
   "actions": [
      "updateFallthrough",
      "updateFlagVariations",
      "updateFeatureWorkflows",
      "updateGlobalArchived",
      "updateOffVariation",
      "updateOn",
      "updatePrerequisites",
      "updateRules",
      "updateScheduledChanges",
      "updateTargets",
      "createFlag",
      "deleteFlag",
      "updateClientSideFlagAvailability",
      "updateFlagDefaultVariations",

      "updateTemporary",
      "createTriggers",
      "deleteTriggers",
      "updateTriggers",
      "updateFlagSalt"
   ]
   ```

1. Save your webhook.
