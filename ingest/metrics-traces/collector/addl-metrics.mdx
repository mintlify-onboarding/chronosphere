title: Ingest additional metrics
---
{/* -- dri: Garrett Guillotte -- */}


Scraping metric endpoints is the preferred method of ingesting metrics to the
Chronosphere Collector, but you can also ingest the following metric formats:

- [Carbon](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/carbon)
- [DogStatsD](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/dogstatsd)
- [Prometheus and OpenMetrics](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/prom-openmetrics)
- [Pushgateway](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/prom-pushgateway)
- [SignalFx](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/signalfx)
- [StatsD](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/statsd)
- [Tagged StatsD](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/tagged-statsd)
- [Wavefront](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/wavefront)

## Enable aggregations

The v0.101.0 release adds an option to enable client-side aggregations for
[Carbon](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/carbon),
[StatsD](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/statsd), and
[Datadog DogStatsD](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics/dogstatsd) metrics.
These aggregations reduce network egress and processed writes to Chronosphere Observability
Platform.

When the Collector ingests a data sample, it aggregates the data based on the metric type
and sends a single data point to Observability Platform that represents the sample for
the defined period. The Collector aggregates on the following metric types:

- Counters, which are rolled up through addition.
- Gauges, which are selected by the last value written.
- Timers, which use sketches of the underlying sample to build quantiles.

Aggregations are disabled by default. To enable aggregations, define the
`push.PROTOCOL.aggregation` YAML collection in your Collector manifest, where
_`PROTOCOL`_ can be `carbon`, `dogstatsd`, or `statsd`. For example, the following
YAML collection enables aggregations for StatsD with defined values for each of the
supported metric types:

```yaml copy
    push:
       statsd:
         aggregation:
           counters:
             interval: "10s"
           gauges:
             interval: "10s"
           timers:
             interval: "10s"
           inactiveExpireAt: "2m"
```

- `interval`: Defines the length of time before writing to Observability Platform.
  A longer `interval` duration provides more effective caching, but also increases
  the length of delays before writing.
- `inactiveExpireAt`: Determines the length of time before Chronosphere evicts unused
  keys from the local cache. Default: `2m`.
