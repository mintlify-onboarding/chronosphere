The rename keys [processing rule](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) changes the name
of a specified key.

## Configuration parameters

<Params />

| Name                    | Key | Description | Default |
| ----------------------- | --- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Source key**          | `src` | Required. The key whose name to change. | _none_ |
| **Destination key**     | `dst` | Required. The new name for your key. If a key with this name already exists, the rule changes the name of **Source key** to this name, which overwrites the original value of **Destination key**. | _none_ |
| **Match case** checkbox   | `matchCase` | Indicates whether the regular expression is case-sensitive. | Not selected |
| **Regex engine**        | `regexEngine` | Required. The [engine](/pipeline-data/processing-rules#regex-engines) to parse your regular expression. Accepted values: `GNU`, `Oniguruma`, `PCRE2`, `POSIX`, `TRE`. | `PCRE2` |
| **Regex mode** checkbox | `regexMode` | Indicates whether the values of the source key and destination key are regular expressions. If selected, **Source key** is treated as a regular expression and **Destination key** is treated as a substitution pattern. | Not selected |
| **Comment**             | `comment` | A custom note or description of the rule's function. This text is displayed next to the rule's name in the **Actions** list in the processing rules interface. | _none_ |

## Example

Using the rename keys rule lets you update the keys that store your telemetry
data and retain the values of those keys.

For example, given the following sample website log data:

```json
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","user_id":4,"page_id":10,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","user_id":5,"page_id":40,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","user_id":1,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z","user_id":2,"page_id":40,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z","user_id":3,"page_id":30,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z","user_id":1,"page_id":20,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","user_id":2,"page_id":50,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z","user_id":2,"page_id":10,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z","user_id":1,"page_id":50,"action":"view"}
```

A processing rule with the **Source key** value `user_id` and the
**Destination key** value `account` returns the following result:

```json
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","account":3,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","account":4,"page_id":10,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:48.643600498Z","account":1,"page_id":50,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","account":5,"page_id":40,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","account":1,"page_id":30,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:56.644080944Z","account":2,"page_id":40,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.64425954Z","account":3,"page_id":30,"action":"click"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:03.644317046Z","account":1,"page_id":20,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","account":2,"page_id":50,"action":"purchase"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:17.644810963Z","account":2,"page_id":10,"action":"view"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:20.644994805Z","account":1,"page_id":50,"action":"view"}
```

This rule changed the name of each `user_id` key to `account`, but kept the original
value associated with those keys.
