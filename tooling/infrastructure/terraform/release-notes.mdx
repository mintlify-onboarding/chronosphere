## Version 1.17.0

Released 2025.11.03

### Feature [#features-v1-17-0]

- Add `ROLLING_1_HOUR_VOLUME` and `ROLLING_3_HOUR_VOLUME` thresholds to `chronosphere_consumption_budget` resource.

## Version 1.16.0

Released 2025.10.22

- Add `emit_metrics` and `replace_fields` control rule types to `chronosphere_log_control_config` resource.
- Add `field_normalization` to `chronosphere_log_ingest_config` resource.

## Version 1.15.0

Released 2025.10.14

### Feature [#features-v1-15-0]

- Add `HOURLY_VOLUME` threshold type to `chronosphere_consumption_budget` resource.

  for customizing consumption budget alerts.

## Version 1.14.0

Released 2025.10.02

### Feature [#features-v1-14-0]

- Add `azure_metrics_integration` resource for configuring the cloudscraper Azure metrics integration.

### Fixes [#fixes-v1-5-1]

- Allow creating `chronosphere_slack_notifier` resources with `actions`, without
  the `action_confirm_text` parameter.
- Fixed an issue where applying a `chronosphere_rollup_rule` or `chronosphere_mapping_rule`
  resource without a defined `interval` or `storage_policy` caused Terraform to continually
  detect a difference.

## Version 1.5.0

Released: 2024.08.29

### Feature [#features-v1-5-0]

- Adds `fixed_value` in `chronosphere_resource_pools_config.pools[].allocation`, which
  lets you specify absolute DPPS per defined pool instead of as a percentage.

### Deprecation [#deprecations-v1-5-0]

  `default_pool.allocation` is now inferred to be any remaining quota unallocated across
  non-default pools.

### Feature [#features-v1-1-0]

- Add server-side validation support for `chronosphere_trace_tail_sampling_rules`

### Deprecations [#deprecations-v1-1-0]

- Deprecates `proxy_url` in alert receivers.
- Deprecates `chronosphere_mapping_rule.drop_timestamp`.

### Fix [#fixes-v1-1-0]

- Fixes an issue where `chronosphere_resource_pools_config` would not allow certain combinations
  of allocation percents due to float arithmetic not adding to exactly 100 percent. The provider
  now relies on server-side validation of pools.

## Version 1.0.0

Released: 2024.05.15

As of version 1.0.0, the Chronosphere Terraform provider is now open source and

provides support for them. Upgrade to at least version 1.0.0 as soon as possible
to continue receiving new features and fixes to the provider.

Legacy versions of the provider remain available on the Chronosphere-hosted Terraform
registry. For instructions on installing older versions, see
