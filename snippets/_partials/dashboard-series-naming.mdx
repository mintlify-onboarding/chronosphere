
**Series naming**: Select a method to filter for metrics:

  - **Labels** require a **Naming pattern**. Use `{{ label_name }}` to include a
    label value. For example, `{{ env }}` will be replaced with values like staging-1, prod-1.
  - **Regex**: Use a [regular expression](/investigate/querying/regular-expressions)
    in the **Regex** text field to match a time series. You can also use a
    **Naming pattern** to rename series using capture groups.
