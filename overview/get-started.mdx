To get started with Observability Platform:

- Open your browser, [authenticate](/overview/authenticating), and sign in.
- View your [home page](/observe/personal-homepage) and navigate directly to your
  favorite resources, or your most recently used ones.
- Locate [dashboards](/observe) to view the health and performance of services that
  matter to your team.
- Investigate [monitors](/investigate/alerts) and configure alerts to generate
  notifications about important data.
- Write [queries](/investigate/querying) to search for pertinent telemetry data, and
  help identify issues during on-call triage.
- Explore [services](/observe/services) to view queries and data visualizations
  related services you care about.
- Learn what metrics are available in the [Metrics Catalog](/investigate/querying/metrics/metrics-catalog).

## Administrators

Administrators and expert users are often the first adopters of observability
software. New users might not understand what they need to know, or how to find and
solve problems. Administrators can create helpful and curated experiences for
incoming developers and other users.

Administrators know how their users are organized - what teams they're on, who's
responsible for what functions, and so on.

At the same time, you need to ingest data to observe. Observability Platform ingests
metrics, traces, and logs, meeting a variety of telemetry coverage needs.

After data is flowing to Observability Platform, create dashboards, alerts, and
services to monitor your data.

Use the provided command-line interfaces, infrastructure as code tools, and APIs for
interacting with the Observability Platform and Telemetry Pipeline products. These
tools include Terraform, Chronoctl, and supported APIs.

Take control of your telemetry data to keep costs predictable and manageable as your
business scales, and help teams manage their data effectively by reducing the amount
of available information. When you optimize your telemetry data, on-call engineers
can find the data they need to solve problems faster.

## Developers

Troubleshooting issues can be time consuming and difficult when you don't know where
to start or how to find the data you need.

You can query and analyze all of your data to help identify issues and determine
which services are causing latency. Use these capabilities in conjunction with
monitors and alerts during incident response when you're trying to identify the
source of an issue.

Mark resources as favorites to display them in your
[personal homepage](/observe/personal-homepage) so they're readily available whenever
you sign in.

PromQL is a complex query language, and users don't necessarily want to spend time
learning it while they're solving problems.

Dashboards provide information on the telemetry and services important to you. Your
administrator might create dashboards for you, or you can create your own with the
data you need the most.

Chronosphere Lens gives you visibility into the health and performance of your
applications by ingesting metrics, traces, logs, and change events that you can
observe using services, dashboards, and service level objectives (SLOs).

Some filters can follow you across pages as you dig into issues and narrow down
where problems lie.
