'og:description': How to debug Chronosphere Collector issues by using available HTTP endpoints.
---
{/* -- dri: Garrett Guillotte -- */}


The Chronosphere Collector exposes HTTP endpoints at the
[`listenAddress`](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/configure/optimizations#define-the-listenaddress)
to return information about the Collector that can help with debugging issues. The
Collector enables these endpoints by default. To disable these endpoints, set
`debug.disabled` to `false` in the Collector manifest.

## Access the debug endpoints

You can access the debug endpoints through your browser. All endpoints except
`/set_log_level` are clickable links on the `/debug` HTML page, and are also directly
accessible with a `GET` request.

1. In the Collector manifest, enable Prometheus discovery and configure at least one
   scrape configuration:

    <Info>
    You must complete this step to access the debug endpoints, regardless of whether
      you're using the Collector to scrape Prometheus endpoints for metrics.
    </Info>

   ```yaml
   prometheus:
        enabled: true
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'access_debug'
            scrape_interval: 30s
            scrape_timeout: 15s
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['192.168.192:9100']
   ```

1. If you're running the Collector with Kubernetes, enable port forwarding:

   ```shell
   kubectl port-forward chronocollector-POD_NAME LISTEN_PORT
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`POD_NAME`_: The name of the Kubernetes pod where your Collector instance is
     running.
   - _`LISTEN_PORT`_: The port where you can access the Collector. The`listenAddress`
     defines this port. Default: `3030`.

1. Open your browser and navigate to the URL where your Collector is running. The
   URL is syntax is _`HOST`_:_`LISTEN_PORT`_`/debug`. For example, if you're running the Collector
   locally, navigate to `localhost:3030/debug`.

1. Click one of the [available endpoints](#available-debug-endpoints) from the list.

## Available debug endpoints

- `/debug`

  Displays an HTML page of all debug endpoints, each of which is accessible by
  clicking an endpoint from the list. This page also displays a list of active scrape
  targets, including the instance name, job name, and scrape statistics. The table
  includes three preview links:

    - **Raw exposition:** Includes the actual output of the target's scrape endpoint.
    - **Dropped series labels:** Lists any dropped labels based on relabel rules.
    - **Ingest series labels:** Displays the final set of time series after processing
    relabel rules.

- `/debug/bundle`

  Downloads a `tar.gz` file that contains JSON files for all debug endpoints. The
  file format is `node-name--date--time.tar.gz`, where `node-name` is the name of the
  node the Collector runs in.

- `/debug/collector_runtime_memory_stats`

  Returns runtime memory metrics for the Collector.

- `/debug/config_dump`

  Returns a JSON representation of the Collector configuration settings defined in
  the `raw_config`, combined with the values for those settings calculated at runtime.

- `/debug/endpoint_slices`

  Returns a JSON list of all Kubernetes EndpointSlices the Collector detects.

- `/debug/job_configs`

  Returns a JSON list of all computed Kubernetes jobs created from the Collector
  configuration.

- `/debug/pods`

  Returns a JSON list of all Kubernetes pods the Collector detects.

- `/debug/pprof`

  Serves a protocol buffer of the Collector in
  [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) format.

- `/debug/raw_config`

  Returns a YAML representation of the settings in the Collector manifest.

- `/debug/service_monitors`

  Returns a JSON list of all dynamic service monitor configurations the Collector
  tracks.

- `/debug/set_log_level`

  Accepts a `PUT` request to temporarily change the logging level of the Collector
  for a specified duration.

  Refer to [temporarily change the Collector log level](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/configure/optimizations#temporarily-change-the-collector-logging-level)
  for more information.

- `/debug/services`

  Returns a JSON list of all Kubernetes Services the Collector detects.

- `/debug/targets`

  Returns a JSON list of key/value pairs that represent all Kubernetes targets the
  Collector monitors. The first element is the Collector configuration, followed by a
  list of all scrape configurations created from the configuration. The endpoint
  doesn't display Graphite targets.

- `/debug/version`

  Returns a JSON representation of the Collector version information. This is the
  same information the Collector displays at startup.
