Chronosphere provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets you connect
your large language models (LLMs) to interact with Chronosphere Observability Platform. After
connecting with the MCP server, you can:

- Query [telemetry data](/overview/types) like change events, metrics, logs, and
  traces.
- Read [Chronosphere resources](/integrate/mcp-server/resources), such as dashboards
  and monitors.

<Info>
You can't use the Chronosphere MCP server to complete mutation actions, such as
updating dashboards, writing metrics and logs, or deleting monitors.

Use AI-enabled developer tools such as [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code),
[Cursor](https://cursor.com/home?from=agents),
[Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/),
and [Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/tree/main) to submit
read-only queries to Observability Platform. The following are some queries you can
make to the Chronosphere MCP server:

- Find error logs in your service with stack traces, and review your code to explain
  what's causing the error.
- Fetch a monitor and explain how it's configured, or what's causing it to trigger.
- Help write PromQL queries to find metrics for a specific service.
- List active shaping rules, such as drop rules, to determine why data is or isn't
  being dropped.

## Get started

To get started with the Chronosphere MCP server,
[configure authentication](/integrate/mcp-server/authenticate).
