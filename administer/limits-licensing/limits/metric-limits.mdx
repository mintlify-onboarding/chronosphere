Chronosphere metrics have a variety of limits, depending on where your data is in the
processing cycle.

Your [license](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing) limits the amount of data you
can write to and store within Chronosphere.

Metrics have the following size limits, which help ensure consistency and prevent
issues with queries:

- Label names: 512 characters
- Label values: 1,024 characters
- Max number of labels: 64 labels
- Total time series bytes: 4,096 characters

[Metrics quotas](/control/shaping/quotas) assign specific percentages of your total
persisted writes limit to pools of metrics. Use quotas to limit groups of metrics and
ensure Chronosphere retains the highest value metrics.

See [Managing invalid metrics](/investigate/querying/metrics/troubleshooting#managing-invalid-metrics)
for information about debugging invalid metrics.

## Late-arriving metrics

Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and other metric formats include one or more timestamp
values for each data point. These values indicate when a sample was observed, or
represent the time range of the data point. Chronosphere Observability Platform can
accept late-arriving data points within a time frame, depending whether the data
point matches an aggregation rule or is ingested without aggregation:

- Aggregation rules accept data points from two minutes to eight minutes past the
  current ingestion time.
- Raw data points can be written to the database up to two hours before the ingestion
  timestamp.

## Future-arriving metrics

Observability Platform accepts incoming metrics one minute ahead of the current
timestamp. If metrics arrive outside of this one-minute buffer, Observability
Platform rejects those metrics and returns an error indicating that metrics arrived
too far into the future.
