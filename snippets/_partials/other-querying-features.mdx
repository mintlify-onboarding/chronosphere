
Observability Platform also provides querying features beyond those covered by using
query languages in its user interface.

- **[Delta queries](/investigate/querying/metrics/delta-queries):** Query metrics that employ
  delta temporality, as opposed to cumulative temporality.
- **[Prometheus API access](/tooling/prometheus-api):**
  Interact directly with Prometheus API endpoints for programmatic workflows.
