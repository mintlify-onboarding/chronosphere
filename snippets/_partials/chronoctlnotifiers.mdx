
To create one or more notifiers using [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl), create a YAML file
that defines them and apply the configuration to your instance.

<Note>
You can use the `notifiers scaffold` command to generate an example notifier, and
then copy the resource definition for your notifier type:

```shell
chronoctl notifiers scaffold
```
