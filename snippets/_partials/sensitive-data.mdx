
<Warning>
Chronosphere recommends you store sensitive data, such as passwords or API tokens,
externally to your configuration files using secrets. You can define variables
with Terraform or use a separate provider to extract secrets from a secret store
(a vault provider, such as [HashiCorp Vault](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/secrets-vault)).

Terraform stores secrets in state as plain text. Refer to the
[Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data)
for other options for storing sensitive data in state.
