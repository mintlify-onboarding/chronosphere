{/* -- dri: Adam Locke -- */}


This dictionary defines metrics created by and specific to Chronosphere Observability
Platform. These metrics are often included in default [dashboards](/overview), and
you can search for them anywhere you use metrics. These curated metrics can help
track basic important information about your Observability Platform instance.

The
[Chronosphere Health Check](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards#chronosphere-health-check)
dashboard includes links to the **Collectors**,
**Usage Dashboard**, and **Licensing Information** dashboards.

Use the [Metrics Catalog](/investigate/querying/metrics/metrics-catalog) to learn
what metrics are in your tenant.

Query these metrics as their respective [Prometheus type](/control/shaping/types#prometheus).

## Capacity limits

[Licensing capacity](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing) is based on your telemetry types and
usage. The following tables describe metrics used for specific sections of your
license.

Chronosphere recommends creating [alerts](/investigate/alerts) using the existing
Capacity Limit metrics, which are also used in the
[License Overview](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#license-overview) dashboard. Use alerts
to be notified when you're close to or over 100% of your license limit and therefore
at risk of experiencing drops:

### Persisted cardinality

The following metrics apply to
[persisted cardinality](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#persisted-cardinality), which is a
cumulative measure that calculates the sum of the unique time series of the persisted
writes that Observability Platform stores, seen over the last 2.5 hours only.

| Metric name | Description |
| ------------| ----------- |
| `chrono_metrics_persisted_cardinality_license_limit` | License limit for active persisted time series cardinality. |
| `chrono_metrics_persisted_cardinality_license_capacity` | Capacity limit for active persisted time series cardinality. |
| `chrono_metrics_persisted_cardinality_license_consumed` | Consumption of the persisted write cardinality limit by datapoint type. |

Query the following metric to understand if data is actively being dropped:

```text
chrono_metrics_persisted_license_dpps_dropped{limit="persisted_cardinality"}
```

### Persisted writes

The following metrics apply to [persisted writes](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#persisted-writes),
which are writes to the Observability Platform database.

| Metric name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `chrono_metrics_persisted_writes_license_dpps_limit` | License limit for persisted write DPPS by datapoint type. |
| `chrono_metrics_persisted_writes_license_dpps_capacity` | Capacity limit for persisted write DPPS by datapoint type. |
| `chrono_metrics_persisted_writes_license_dpps_consumed` | Consumption rate in DPPS of persisted write license by datapoint type. |

For each of these metrics, you can query by `datapoint_type`, such as `histogram` or
`standard`. For the `_dpps_capacity` and `_dpps_consumed` metrics, you can
additionally query by `pool_name`, and `priority`.

For example, the following query returns the consumption rate in DPPS of your
persisted write license for `histogram` data points on the `Auth Services` pool.
Because `priority` isn't specified, the query returns a series for each priority:

```text
chrono_metrics_persisted_writes_license_dpps_consumed{datapoint_type="histogram", pool_name="Auth Services"}
```

If you wanted to return only high priority histogram data points for the
`Auth Services` pool, specify `priority = "high"` in your query:

```text
chrono_metrics_persisted_writes_license_dpps_consumed{datapoint_type="histogram", pool_name="Auth Services", priority="high"}
```

Query the following metric to understand if data is actively being dropped:

```text
chrono_metrics_persisted_license_dpps_dropped{limit="persisted_writes"}
```

### Matched writes

The following metrics apply to [matched writes](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#aggregations),
which are the number of writes per second being matched for transformation and
reshaping by the Observability Platform aggregation tier.

| Metric name | Description |
| ------------| ----------- |
| `chrono_metrics_matched_writes_license_dpps_limit`    | License limit for matched write DPPS by datapoint type. |
| `chrono_metrics_matched_writes_license_dpps_capacity` | Capacity limit for matched write DPPS by datapoint type. |
| `chrono_metrics_matched_writes_license_dpps_consumed` | Consumption rate in DPPS of matched write license by datapoint type. |

Query the following metric to understand if data is actively being dropped:

```text
chrono_metrics_matched_license_dpps_dropped
```

### Legacy licensing metrics

The following table explains metrics that might be present in your environment, but
will be replaced by new metrics. The following metrics replace this table:

- [Persisted writes](#persisted-writes)
- [Persisted cardinality](#persisted-cardinality)
- [Matched writes](#matched-writes)

These metrics create the following tags during
[dashboard creation](/observe/dashboards#create-a-dashboard):

- `chronosphere_service`

## Collectors

The **Collectors** dashboard includes the following metrics that Collectors generate.
Use this dashboard to monitor the health of your Collectors.
