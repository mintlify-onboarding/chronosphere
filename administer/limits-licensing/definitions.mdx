Chronosphere Observability Platform uses the following definitions for licensing
units:

- _Active Time Series_ (`ATS`) is the total number of unique time series, defined
  as distinct combinations of metric names and labels, measured within a 2.5 hour
  time window.
- _Control_ is the volume of data that undergoes transformation and reshaping.
  Control is measured in `GB` for traces, `GB` for logs, and matched writes for
  metrics.
- _Long Term Retention_ is the number of months Chronosphere will retain data at
  a negotiated resolution.
- _Matched Writes_ (`mW`) are the number of writes per second being matched for
  transformation and reshaping. For more information, see
  [aggregations](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#aggregations).
- _Persisted Cardinality_ is the count of unique time series of the
  persisted writes stored by Chronosphere. For more information, see
  [persisted cardinality](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#persisted-cardinality).
- _Persisted Writes Per Minute_ (`WPM`) is the total count of individual, timestamped
  data points persisted in a one-minute interval. For more information, see
  [persisted writes](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#persisted-writes).
- _Persisted Writes Per Second_ (`WPS`) is the total count of individual, timestamped
  data points persisted in a one-second interval.
- _Persistence_ is the volume of data stored following processing by control.
  Persistence is measured in `GB` for traces, `GB` for logs, `WPM` for events,
  and cardinality and resolution for metrics.
- _Raw Retention_ is the number of days Chronosphere will retain raw data. For more
  information, see [ingestion limits and retention policies](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#ingestion-limits-and-retention-policies).
- _Resolution_ is the ratio of active time series to persisted writes per second.
- _Time series_ is a set of data points with matching labels.
