<EarlyAccess/>

The sidebar of [alert details pages](/investigate/alerts/alert-details) provides
links to a panel where you can **analyze alert patterns** through a heatmap visualization
and a table of associated alerts. You can analyze patterns by time range or by other
alerts triggered by the same source, such as a [monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors)
or [service level objective (SLO)](/observe/slo).

As you interact with the heatmap, you also filter the table view to list only the
alerts triggered at that intersection of time and
[filter type](#sort-and-filter-the-heatmaps-alerts) (such as label, source, notifier,
or notification policy).

Use this panel to visually identify other alerts that might be related due to their
activity relative to the triggered alert's duration or other signals in the same source.

## Search and filter alerts

You can toggle between alerts from the source entity, such as **Source monitor**
or **Source SLO**, or from **Related alerts** from any source based on the selected
[time range](/navigate/time-ranges).

### Add labels to search

When you navigate to the **Analyze alert patterns** panel from an alert details page,
the panel's **Search alerts** field is populated with labels from the triggering
alert's time series. You can optionally **Add labels** by clicking on this field,
and then entering a **Label**, selecting an operator, and entering a **Value**.
To confirm the new label, click **<Icon icon="check" /> Confirm**.

You can also narrow the view to specific **Notification policies**, **Notifiers**,
and **Severities**. By default, each of these fields select **All** available values.
You can also filter by firing alerts' **Minimum** and **Maximum durations**.

If the selection and time range include muted alerts, you can toggle whether to
**Show muted alerts**. The number of identified muted alerts is displayed with the
toggle.

## Analyze alerts in a heatmap visualization

A heatmap visualization displays each group of alerts as a row, and the number of
times each group was triggered during a fraction of the displayed time range as
a shaded cell.

Darker cells indicate a higher triggering frequency. A bar chart across the top of
the cells indicates the relative total number of firing alerts during that fraction
of the time range. Use the heatmap and its controls to identify clusters of alerts
that you can use to correlate or exclude other firing alerts as being related to
the selected alert.

The heatmap depicts a fixed number of rows. If there are more rows than are visible
in the heatmap, you can scroll the heatmap vertically to view more.

### Sort and filter the heatmap's alerts

When you click on a cell in the heatmap, you filter the
[table view](#analyze-alerts-by-source-in-a-table) to list only the alerts triggered
at that intersection. When you click on a cell in the bar chart, you filter the
table view to all alerts triggered during that fraction of the time range. To clear
your selection, click the selected cell again.

The panel also divides the same time range that you selected in the alert details
view into equal spans and depicts these spans as the heatmap's columns. You can
use the [time range selector](/navigate/time-ranges) to change this total range,
but the number of divisions and columns remains the same. The heatmap's X axis
includes times for several columns in the chart.

Additionally, you can use the **Sort by** dropdown to change whether to sort the
heatmap's rows by alert count or alphabetically, and whether to sort by ascending
or descending values. By default, the heatmap is sorted by **Alert count (high to low)**.

You can also use the **Group by** dropdown to customize how the rows are defined.
Rows are grouped by **Label** by default, and you can choose to group by source
entity (**Monitor/SLO**), by **Notifier**, or by **Notification Policy**. You can
additionally filter the rows by members of those groups by clicking the following
dropdown, which adapts to use the same name as the value of the **Group by** dropdown.

As you modify these controls, the section heading changes to count the selected
type of entities associated with the number of total active alerts.

## Analyze alerts by source in a table

The panel also includes a table that by default lists all active alerts by their
source and includes columns for the alert's:

- **Severity**, as an icon:

  | Icon | Text | Description |
  | ---- | ---- |------------ |
  | <Icon icon="hexagon-exclamation" color="#ee6c6cff"/> | **Critical** | Actively triggered alert that exceeds the defined critical conditions. |
  | <Icon icon="circle-exclamation" color="#ffb249ff"/>    | **Warning**  | Actively triggered alert that exceeds the defined warning conditions.  |
  | <Icon icon="bell-slash" color="#c1a6f8ff"/>   | **Muted**    | Alert that's muted by an active muting rule.                           |
- Name (**Alert**), as a link to the alert's details page
- **Alert state, such as **active** or **triggered**
- **Alert ID**
- **Source monitor/SLO**, as a link

As you [sort and filter the heatmap's alerts](#sort-and-filter-the-heatmaps-alerts),
the table's list changes to include only the alerts for that selection. The table
also lists the start and end points in the selected fraction of the total time range.

## Share the analysis view

To share a direct link to this panel, click the **<Icon icon="link-simple" /> Copy URL**
icon. You can then choose to **Copy with absolute time range** to share the view
with a specific beginning and end time range, or **Copy with relative time range**
to share the view for a relative range (such as the default last 1 hour).
