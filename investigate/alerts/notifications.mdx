When a monitor generates an alert in Chronosphere Observability Platform, it triggers
_notifiers_ based on the assigned _notification policy_.

[Notifiers](/investigate/alerts/notifications/notifiers) are the endpoints receiving
notifications, including where to deliver alerts and who to notify. You can configure
notifiers to send details of the alert to a channel such as email, PagerDuty, or
Slack.

Observability Platform also supports unfurling of monitor graphs in
[Slack](/investigate/alerts/notifications/slack). This integration enables Slack
users to view or share monitors in Slack channels aimed at mitigating alerts.

[Notification policies](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies) are rules that determine how
to route notifications to notifiers based on signals that trigger from monitors.
Teams own notification policies, and assign them either to a specific monitor or set
as a default policy for all monitors in a specified collection.

Optionally, you can use [signals](/investigate/alerts/notifications/signals) to create groups of
notifications. Signals determine how to group alerts, which affects how many
notifications Observability Platform sends.

To view a history of alerts for a monitor, in the navigation menu select
**<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerts <span aria-label="and then">></span> Monitors**
and then click the [Alert history](/investigate/alerts/monitors#alert-history) tab
for the selected monitor.
