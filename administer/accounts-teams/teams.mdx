A _team_ defines how an organization grants permissions for sensitive
management and administrative operations to _accounts_, including
[_user accounts_](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts) and
[_service accounts_](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts).

A team's accounts have a shared responsibility for certain services. Chronosphere
Observability Platform represents those services as
[_collections_](/administer/collections), which contain resources related to the
service a collection represents, such as dashboards and monitors. A team can own
multiple collections.

All user and service accounts in a team that has the special System Administrator
(`SysAdmin`) role are _administrators_. If you're an administrator, you can
[add this role to a team](#add-a-role-to-a-team).

Teams can own collections and services, which in turn own other functions:

   constrain your results to only Teams.
1. Click the search result you're interested in, or use the arrow keys to select it
   and press enter, to go to that team.

### View teams and their collections

To view teams and the collections they own, in the navigation menu exit the **Admin**
menu (if needed, click **<Icon icon="arrow-right-from-bracket" /> Exit Admin**) and select
**<CollectionNavIcon /> Collections**. For details about working with collections,
see [Collections](/administer/collections).

### View a list of teams to manage

To view teams in a list that displays their members, provides an audit log of
membership changes, and includes management options for administrators:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud">

In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin** and then select
**<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Teams**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl">

Use the command:

```shell copy
chronoctl teams list
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

For details, see
[Accounts and Teams](/administer/accounts-teams#view-accounts-and-teams).

## Manage teams

<Info>
To manage teams, you must use a user account or
[service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts) that belongs to a team
with the SysAdmin role.
</Info>

To manage teams, in the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin**
and then select **<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Teams**.

### Create a team

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="create-a-team-cloud">

To create a new team:

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin**
   and then select
   **<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Teams**.
1. Click **Create team**.
1. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for the new team and the access role it
   should have.
1. Click **Save** to create the team.

The team now appears in the list of users and teams.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="create-a-team-chronoctl">

<Warning>
To create teams or modify team membership with Chronoctl, you must use a user account
or [service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts) that
belongs to a team with the SysAdmin role.
</Warning>

To create and manage a team with [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl),
use the `Team` resource type. The resource can contain these fields:

| Field         | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `name`        | String | The team name as displayed in Observability Platform. |
| `slug`        | String | Optional. A unique identifier that Observability Platform uses to identify the team. If omitted, Observability Platform generates a slug. |
| `description` | String | Optional. A description displayed when viewing this team. |
| `user_emails` | Collection of strings | Contains an item for each member account's email address. |

To generate an example Team resource, run `chronoctl teams scaffold`.

If an email address in `users` doesn't already have an Observability Platform
account, the app creates a pending user account for that email address. When that
user signs in, Observability Platform then activates the account.

For example, this YAML resource creates a team named `DBAs` in Observability
Platform, with the description `Database administrators`, and which the app
identifies with the slug `dbas`. It also includes the listed accounts identified by
their email addresses as team members:

```yaml
api_version: v1/config
kind: Team
spec:
  name: DBAs
  slug: dbas
  description: "Database administrators"
  user_emails:
    - adam@example.com
    - betty@example.com
```

To include service accounts, add the service account's internal email address to
the `users` list. For details, see [Service Accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Terraform" id="create-a-team-terraform">

<Warning>
To create teams or modify team membership with Terraform, you must use a user account
or [service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts) that
belongs to a team with the SysAdmin role.
</Warning>

To create and manage a team with [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform),
declare the `chronosphere_team` resource type and provide a resource name. The resource
can contain these fields:

| Field         | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `name`        | String | The team name as displayed in Observability Platform. |
| `slug`        | String | Optional. A unique identifier that Observability Platform uses to identify the team. If omitted, Observability Platform generates a slug. |
| `description` | String | Optional. A description displayed when viewing this team. |
| `user_emails` | Array of strings | The email address for each member account. |

For example, this resource creates a team referred to by Terraform as `dbas`, named
`DBAs` in Observability Platform, and identified in the app with the slug `dbas`. It
also includes the listed accounts identified by their email addresses as team
members:

```ruby
resource "chronosphere_team" "dbas" {
  name = "DBAs"
  slug = "dbas"
  description = "Database administrators"

  user_emails = [
    "adam@example.com",
    "betty@example.com",
  ]
}
```

To include service accounts, add the service account's internal email address to
the `user_emails` array. For details, see [Service Accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts).

### Edit team membership

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="edit-team-membership-cloud">

To add users to or remove users from a team:

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin** and then select
   **<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Teams**.
1. [Select the team](/administer/accounts-teams#view-accounts-and-teams-cloud)
   to manage.
1. Click **<Icon icon="pencil" /> Edit Team**.
1. In the **Team Members** section, click **Update Membership**.
1. From the account list that appears, select the checkbox for each account you want
   to add to the team, and clear the checkbox for each account you want to remove
   from the team.
1. Click **Save** to edit the team's membership.

The team page updates its membership list accordingly, and the audit log adds an
entry logging the operation.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="edit-team-membership-chronoctl-apply">

<Warning>
To modify teams with Chronoctl, you must use a user account or
[service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts) that
belongs to a team with the `SysAdmin` role.
</Warning>

You can use [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) to replace and update a team and
its membership with those defined in a YAML file.

To generate a YAML description of your current teams and accounts, see
[View Accounts and Teams](/administer/accounts-teams#view-accounts-and-teams-chronoctl).

Following the `DBAs` team example from [creating a team](#create-a-team),
to add a user to that team, update the YAML to include the new user's email:

```yaml
api_version: v1/config
kind: Team
spec:
  name: DBAs
  slug: dbas
  description: "Database administrators"
  user_emails:
    - adam@example.com
    - betty@example.com
    - charles@example.com
```

To apply the changes, use the Chronoctl `chronoctl teams update` command, which
updates teams but doesn't create them if they don't already exist:

```shell copy /FILE_NAME/
chronoctl teams update -f FILE_NAME.yaml
```

Replace _`FILE_NAME`_ with the path to the YAML definition file.

You can test the changes without applying them by including the `--dry-run` flag:

```shell copy /FILE_NAME/
chronoctl teams update -f FILE_NAME.yaml --dry-run
```

To force `teams update` to create a defined team if it doesn't exist, include the
`--create-if-missing` flag:

```shell copy /FILE_NAME/
chronoctl teams update -f FILE_NAME.yaml --create-if-missing
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Terraform" id="edit-team-membership-terraform">

To edit a team's membership using [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform), modify the
`user_emails` array in the team's `chronosphere_team` resource, and then apply the
resource using Terraform.

</Tab>
<Tab title="API">

To complete this action with the Chronosphere API, use the
[`UpdateTeam`](/tooling/api-info/definition/operations/UpdateTeam) endpoint.

<ApiAuthReq />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Assign team roles and permissions

Observability Platform teams use _roles_ to grant or restrict access to features
that create, edit, or delete resources, teams, and accounts. Roles are assigned
to teams, and all accounts that belong to a team gain the permissions granted by
that team's role.

During creation, accounts are assigned to the **Default** team, which has the `Editor`
role. The **Default** team can't be deleted, and its role can't be changed.
[Service accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts#create-an-unrestricted-service-account)
also can't be removed from the **Default** team and therefore always have **Editor**
access.

<Info>
To remove editing access from a user,
[remove the user from the **Default** team](#edit-team-membership). This limits
the user to read-only access provided they don't have edit
access through membership in another team.
</Info>

The available roles are:

- `None`: Accounts on teams with this role can view pages in Observability Platform
  but can't create, edit, or remove resources or accounts. Accounts that don't
  belong to any team also have the `None` role by default.
- `Editor`: Accounts on teams with this role can create, view, edit, and delete
  resources within Observability Platform, but can't create, edit, or delete accounts
  and teams.
- `SysAdmin`: Any account that's a member of a team with the System Administrator
  (`SysAdmin`) role can create, edit, and delete accounts and teams, assign accounts
  to teams, and assign roles to teams. Accounts with this role are designated by a
  <Icon icon="key" /> key icon next to their name in the **Users** list.
- `User Administrator`: Accounts belonging to teams with this role can access the
  System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) API, which manages accounts
  that use single sign-on. This role grants no other permissions.

  The `User Administrator` role can be assigned to teams only in organizations that
  have SCIM integration enabled. For more information, see
  [Okta user synchronization](/administer/accounts-teams/okta).

If an account belongs to multiple teams with different roles, they inherit the
highest-level permissions of each assigned team. For example, an account in a team
with the `Editor` role and a second team with the `SysAdmin` role has both sets of
privileges.

The following chart summarizes roles and permissions:

{/* vale off */}

| Action                                 | None        | Editor      | SysAdmin    | User Admin   |
| -------------------------------------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :----------: |
| Interact with SCIM API                 | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  | <NoIcon />  | <YesIcon />  |
