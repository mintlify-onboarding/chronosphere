Log data provides your teams with more detailed context to help identify and fix the
root causes of issues. However, not all logs provide the same utility, and you don't
want to consume a portion of your license with unnecessary logs.

Chronosphere Observability Platform provides grouping and budgeting mechanisms that
let you structure log usage by ownership and purpose that matter to your
organization. You can then [shape log data](/control/consumption/shape-logs/parse-logs)
to apply finer-grained control.

To help control log data usage, first create
[_partitions_](/control/consumption/partitions), which are slices of your log data
with distinct owners. For example, you can create partitions for individual services,
teams, and environments to provide a consistent structure for attributing usage and
costs to the proper owners.

Partitions let you apply [_budgets_](/control/consumption/budgeting), which are
optional shaping policies you can assign to a partition to safeguard against runaway
usage and overspending.

After defining partitions, use the
[Logging License Consumption dashboard](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards#licensing-overview)
to view persisted log data consumption against license capacity.

## How to control log data

To manage your log data consumption, complete the following steps:

1. [Create partitions](/control/consumption/partitions).
1. [Analyze consumption](/control/consumption/analyze).
1. Optional: [Create budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting).
1. [Monitor budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting#next-steps).
1. [Shape log data](/control/consumption/shape-logs).
