## Workflow patterns

Observability Platform includes many tools, each of which are best suited for
specific workflows. Every user needs to authenticate and sign in, but on-call
engineers might be most interested in querying data, while data curators might want to use
control tools to reduce persisted data and manage costs.

[administrators](/overview/get-started#administrators) and
