Users of Chronosphere Observability Platform might have wide responsibilities while
other users are focused on specific sets of resources. Users who consistently use the
same resources can _favorite_ them for quicker access on the user's
[personal homepage](/observe/personal-homepage), or by filtering a resource list
to their favorites.

Favorite items are listed first in search results.

Favorites are available for the following resources:

- [Dashboards](/observe/dashboards)
- [Monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors)

Users can designate favorite resources in several ways.

- From the resource list page:
  1. In the navigation menu, navigate to the list page for the resource.
  1. Click the **<Icon icon="star" />star** icon next to the resource name.

- From the resource itself:
  1. Select a dashboard or monitor.
  1. In the title bar, click the **<Icon icon="star" />star** icon.

- From your personal homepage:

  If you have recently visited the resource, the resource appears in its **Recent**
  section. Click the **<Icon icon="star" />star** icon.
