The parse number [processing rule](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) uses a regular
expression to transform a key's value from a string to a number.

## Configuration parameters

<Params />

| Name                      | Key | Description | Default |
| ------------------------- | --- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Key**          | `key` | Required. The key whose value contains a number to parse. | _none_ |
| **Regex**        | `regex` | Required. The regular expression for extracting numbers from the value of **Key**. | `[+-]?([0-9]+([.][0-9]*)?\|[.][0-9]+)` |
| **Numeric base** | `base` | Required. The base system of the number stored in **Key**. As part of the parsing process, this rule converts each number from its original base system to decimal. | `10` |
| **Comment**      | `comment` | A custom note or description of the rule's function. This text is displayed next to the rule's name in the **Actions** list in the processing rules interface. | _none_ |

## Examples

Using the parse number process rule lets you extract numeric data from a string,
which makes it possible to perform math operations on that data.

### Decimal

For example, given these sample logs:

```json
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","user_id":3,"action":"purchase","price":"$057.99"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","user_id":4,"action":"purchase","price":"$173.28"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","user_id":5,"action":"purchase","price":"$004.72"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","user_id":1,"action":"purchase","price":"$096.65"}
{"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","user_id":2,"action":"purchase","price":"$020.11"}
```

A processing rule with the **Key** value `price`, the **Regex** value
`[+-]?([0-9]+([.][0-9]*)?|[.][0-9]+)`, and the **Numeric base** value `10` returns
the following result:

```json
{"user_id":3,"price":57.99,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:41.64283645Z","action":"purchase"}
{"user_id":4,"price":173.28,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:42.643343109Z","action":"purchase"}
{"user_id":5,"price":4.72,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:50.643773688Z","action":"purchase"}
{"user_id":1,"price":96.65,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:08:51.643932272Z","action":"purchase"}
{"user_id":2,"price":20.11,"timestamp":"2023-03-28T09:09:10.64447719Z","action":"purchase"}
```

This rule transformed the value of each `price` key from a string to a number, and
discarded non-numeric characters and leading zeroes contained in the original string.

### Binary

You can also the **Numeric base** setting to parse numbers in other base formats,
like binary. For example, given these sample logs:

```json

{"node":"1001010100010110"}
{"node":"1001000001100010"}
{"node":"1011010010011110"}
{"node":"1101010111111011"}
{"node":"0000000011011000"}
```

A processing rule with the **Key** value `node`, the **Regex** value
`[+-]?([0-9]+([.][0-9]*)?|[.][0-9]+)`, and the **Numeric base** value `2` returns
the following result:

```json
{"node":38166}
{"node":36962}
{"node":46238}
{"node":54779}
{"node":216}
```

This rule transformed the value of each `node` key from a string to a number,
then converted that number from binary to decimal.
