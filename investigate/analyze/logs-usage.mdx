{/* -- dri: Adam Locke -- */}


Chronosphere Observability Platform provides usage data and utility scores for your
log data. Usage analysis gives you insight into _patterns_, which are frequent
combinations of specific `service` and `message` fields in your log data. The
**Logs Usage** page displays the volume of data each pattern consumes, and where and
how often each pattern gets queried. The more a pattern is queried, included in
assets like dashboards, and referenced by unique users, the higher its utility score.

Utility scores are relative, and aren't mapped to any scale. For example, a utility
score of 18 is more than twice that of a utility score of 8, but isn't scored against
a maximum. Lower utility scores indicate patterns that are candidates for reducing,
augmenting, or routing log data to lower costs.

## View log patterns

View log patterns in the **Logs Usage** page to analyze which patterns have greater
utility, and those patterns you can potentially eliminate.

To view log patterns:

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield-user" /> Go to Admin**
   and then select
   **<Icon icon="microscope" /> Analyzers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Logs Usage**.

   The **Logs Usage** page displays all patterns found in your log data.

1. Click any pattern to view more detailed information, such as the number of queries
   that reference the pattern across [Logs Explorer](/investigate/querying/query-logs)
   and in [dashboards](/investigate/querying/dashboard-query).

   On the **Pattern Details** page, expand the **Executions** column to see which
   users have executed a query containing this pattern.

1. To view the underlying query for the pattern in Logs Explorer, hold the pointer
   over any pattern, and then click **View in Logs Explorer**.

## Create control rules

When viewing a log pattern in Observability Platform, you can create a log
[control rule](/control/consumption/shape-logs/control-logs) for the selected
pattern. This capability lets you manage log data by transforming, reshaping,
retaining, or excluding data before it’s stored.

To create control rules:

{/* vale off */}
{/* regex is in the name of the UI */}
1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield-user" /> Go to Admin**
   and then select
   **<Icon icon="microscope" /> Analyzers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Logs Usage**.

   The **Logs Usage** page displays all patterns found in your log data.

1. Click the log pattern you want to create a control rule for.
1. In the **Pattern Details** page, click **Create control rule for this pattern**.

   The **Create control rule page** opens with the filter for the log pattern
   predefined.
1. Press `Ctrl+Enter` (`Command+Return` on macOS) to submit the
   filter. This rule applies to logs that match only this filter at the time the log
   data was ingested.
1. Review the returned data from the preview filter, and make changes as necessary.
1. Enter additional information for the specified action:
   - **Drop fields**: In the **Parent path** field, enter the level of depth in the
     log to apply the regular expression to. For example, if you wanted to apply the
     regular expression to fields under `httpRequest`, such as `httpRequest.status`,
     enter `httpRequest` in the **Parent path** field.

     In the **Field regex** field, enter the regular expression that determines which
     fields to match on.
   - **Sample logs**: In the **Logs to keep** field, enter the percentage of logs you
     want to keep. For example, `25` for 25%.
1. Click **Save** to save the control rule definition.
1. In the **Code Config** tab, [use the Code Config tool](/tooling/gitops) to apply
   the definition.
