After you sign in, Chronosphere Observability Platform displays your personal
_home page_. This home page contains [panels](#panels) that display recently
viewed, recently modified, or favorite resources. New users will often have
empty panels.

## Customize your home page

You can customize your home page by adding, removing, or rearranging panels. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. On the Observability Platform home page, click
   **<Icon icon="gear" /> Customize your home page**.
1. Select the panels you want to add to your home page, or deselect the panels
   you want to remove. You can also drag and drop the panels to change the order
   in which they appear.
1. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

## Panels

The following panels are available in the Observability Platform home page.

### Activity feed

The **Activity feed** panel displays information about recently created,
updated, and deleted Chronosphere entities. This information is listed in
reverse chronological order.

Use the **Exclude service accounts** toggle to view or hide updates performed by
[service accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts).

### Favorite resources

Your [favorite](/navigate/favorites) resources are those you've selected either from
the recent resources panels or from their areas of Observability Platform. Adding
favorite resources helps you access the resources you need the most, faster.

Panels for favorite resources include:

- **Favorite dashboards**
- **Favorite monitors**

### Recent comments

The **Recent comments** panel displays a list of the most recent
[comments](/navigate/comments) added by your team members. These comments are
listed in reverse chronological order, and by default include comments added to
any entities by any team members.

Click the <Icon icon="filter" />filter icon to show or hide filters.
You can use the following filters:

- **Search by comment keyword <Icon icon="magnifying-glass" />**: Filter comments by
  content. This filter searches the body text of comments, but not the name of
  the entity to which the comment was added or the team member who added it.
  This filter is case-sensitive.
- **@mentions**: If this toggle is enabled, only comments that mention your
  username are displayed.
- **Filter by author**: Filter comments by the team members who added them. You
  can select one or more authors.
- **Filter by type**: Filter comments by the type of entity they were added to.
  You can select one or more entity types.

### Recent resources

Viewing resources in Observability Platform adds those resources to the relevant
panel on your home page, up to the most recent ten. For example, viewing any
dashboard adds a link to that dashboard to the **Recent dashboards** panel.

Panels for recent resources include:

- [**Recent dashboards**](/observe/dashboards)
- [**Recent monitors**](/investigate/alerts/monitors)
- [**Recent SLOs**](/observe/slo)
