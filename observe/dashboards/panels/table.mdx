A _table_ panel organizes and displays the data returned by a
[query](/investigate/querying) as table with sortable columns. Tables can
interpret time series data as columns or rows, or can render each raw data
point from a series in its own row. You can also add columns for each label
in a series, and for common calculations of each series' data.

To create a table chart or learn more about the configuration options common
to all panels, see [Panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).

## Table chart queries

Table charts use one or more
[queries](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-query) to retrieve data to
visualize. Table charts use the following query **Options** to refine the
displayed information, depending on your **Datasource**:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Metrics (Prometheus)">

- **Type**: The [PromQL query](/investigate/querying/promql#basic-querying)
  type: **Instant**, or **Range**.
<DashboardDownsampleTruncate />

</Tab>
<Tab title="Logs">

For logs, enter a valid query.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Query example

The following example creates a table with multiple label values:

```text copy
sum by (instance, environment) (METRIC_NAME)
```

Replace _`METRIC_NAME`_ with the name of any metric with labels.

## Use a table's tooltip

Observability Platform truncates the display of table values that exceed a column's
width. To view the complete value, hold the pointer over the truncated value in the
table.

## Export a table as CSV

You can export a table's values as a CSV file.

1. In the panel, click the <Icon path= { mdiDotsVertical } /> icon.
2. Select **Export CSV**.

## Configure a table

You can configure a table by
[modifying its **Settings**](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).

Any changes you make in the panel's **Settings** tab are immediately reflected in
the **Preview** pane, but take effect only when you click **Apply** in the **Edit panel**
interface and then **Save** the dashboard.

Observability Platform doesn't fully support directly editing a panel's JSON representation
and recommends configuring panels in the user interface. Use the JSON representation
only for managing your configuration as code with tools such as [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl)
and [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform).

### Modify a table's data format

The **Data Format** section in a table's **Settings** tab defines how the table
interprets the panel's query results for tabular display.

To define the table's data format, select a **Time series format**.

- **Series to Rows** displays each series as a row in the table. You must also select
  which **Calculations** to apply to the series and display in the table. If the
  series contains labels, you can also toggle **Label-based columns**, which adds
  a column for each series' label when enabled.
- **Series to Columns** displays each series as a column in the table. Each row
  in the table represents one data point in the series with the timestamp indicated
  in the **Time** column.
- **Raw** displays the timestamp and value for each data point of a selected series.

### Modify a table's sorting

The **Sorting** section in a table's **Settings** tab controls the table's sorting
order.

- **Sort by**: Determines the column used to sort the table.
- **Sort order**: Determines whether display the table's contents by its **Default**
  original data order, or to sort it in **Ascending** or **Descending** order.
  Observability Platform disables this field until you select a **Sort by** column.

To add multiple sorting criteria:

1. Set a **Sort by** column.
1. Click **+** (**Add sort**) to add a sorting criteria.

To remove a sorting criteria, click **<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete**
on the row of the criteria you want to remove.

### Modify a table's units

The **Display** section in a table's **Settings** tab controls how Observability
Platform interprets the units of data in the table.

<DashboardUnits />

### Configure a table's thresholds

The **Thresholds** section in a table chart's **Settings** tab defines values where
Observability Platform renders each threshold range. You can set a single threshold
to differentiate, or multiple thresholds to indicate severity level. For example,
you might want a warning value in orange, and a critical value in red.

To create a new threshold:

1. Edit a table panel.
1. Click the **Settings** tab.
1. In the **Thresholds** section, click the <Icon path = { mdiPlus} /> plus icon.
1. Enter a value in the **When value is >=** text box.
1. Use the color box to select a color for the threshold.
1. Optional: Click (**>**) to expand a row and update the **Message** field.
1. Click the <Icon path = { mdiPlus} /> plus icon to add more threshold levels.
1. When finished, click **Apply**.

After applying the changes, the table updates with the selected color highlighting
the violated threshold.

To delete a threshold value, click the caret (>) to expand the threshold definition,
and then click
**<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete threshold**.

### Configure a table's columns

The **Table columns** tab in a table's **Edit panel** interface controls whether
to display certain columns in the table and lets you edit their headings. The
tab lists each table column in a separate row.

- **Visibility**: Toggles whether to display the column.
- **Name**: Displays the column's original name.
- **Display Name**: Defines the name used in the column's header.
- **Order**: Use the arrows to reorder the table.
