Chronosphere uses the following ingest limits for tracing data. If you exceed one or
more of these limits, Chronosphere truncates or rejects the data depending on the
limit itself. Exceeding a limit indicates that you might need to modify your
client-side instrumentation, or implement head or tail
[sampling rules](/control/sampling) to drop data that you don't want to
persist.

The following limits are in increasing order of granularity from most granular to
most broad.

## Invalid tags

Chronosphere limits the size of a tag to 200 bytes for any span. Chronosphere accepts
and processes the first 200 bytes and truncates any additional bytes. The related
span and trace aren't otherwise impacted by this limit.

## Invalid spans

If the start time of a span is greater than 10 minutes before or after the current
time, Chronosphere marks the span as invalid and drops it. The parent trace isn't
impacted, provided that the other spans in the trace have valid start times.

## Invalid traces

Chronosphere persists individual traces with 100,000 spans or fewer. If a trace has
more than 100,000 spans, Chronosphere rejects the trace and all included spans.

Although Chronosphere rejects invalid tracing data, you can view rejected data in the
Trace Control Plane, or by querying the
`chrono_trace_dropped_volume_in_bytes_count` metric. You can also
[create a monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors#create-a-monitor) for this metric and generate
notifications when tracing data is rejected. The following query returns invalid
trace data by reason, such as when a span is too far in the past:

```shell
sum(rate(chrono_trace_dropped_volume_in_bytes_count[5m])) by (reason) > 0
```

## Pod limits

Chronosphere limits data ingest to 2 GB per minute for each Kubernetes pod that
handles data ingest. Chronosphere scales these pods automatically to handle current
traffic, and imposes this limit to protect against sudden traffic surges to a single
pod. Your tenant might have anywhere from two to 100 pods at any given time,
depending on current load. The total ingest limit in one minute depends on the number
of pods in use times the 2 GB per minute for each pod.

## System limits

Chronosphere scales as rapidly as possible to manage sudden changes in trace data
volume. However, sudden spikes might trigger surge protections that drop trace data
until more resources are available. This system limit allows the majority of normally
observed data fluctuation patterns and guarantees the reliability of the Chronosphere
trace ingestion pipeline in the case of unexpected volume changes. Trace data volume
exceeding this limit is visible in the Trace Control Plane as a metric tracking
volume of traces dropped due to limiting.
