To help you understand your network's health, and to troubleshoot issues that occur,
Chronosphere Observability Platform includes tools and features to provide actionable
insights into each type of telemetry data you ingest.

 <Columns cols={1}>
  <CustomCard

    />}>

  Aggregate measurements from your services and apps, such as a fixed number
  of periodic observations that record the count of requests handled over the span
  of a minute. Observability Platform adds, drops, and aggregates those statistics
  for use in dashboards, traces, and alerts.

  <CustomCard
  title="Logs"

  Data directly generated by apps and services, which you can ingest with
  Observability Platform to investigate issues with your systems and monitor their
  health. Use Logs Explorer to search log data so your teams have more detailed context
  to help identify and fix the root cause of issues.

  Mapping and analyzing requests as they flow through a distributed system. Traces
  include _spans_ that an app emits, and connects related spans together. Each span
  represents an operation or unit of work.

  Data elements that describe real world changes or events that could have affected
  your environment. Events let you answer questions like _When did a particular
  service deploy last?_
