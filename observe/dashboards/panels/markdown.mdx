<ClassicPanel />

A _Markdown panel_ renders [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) content. Use
Markdown panels to document important information or context into a
[dashboard](/observe/dashboards).

To create a Markdown panel or learn more about the configuration options common
to all panels, see [Panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).

## Add content to a Markdown panel

To add content to a Markdown panel:

1. [Edit the Markdown panel](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).
1. In the **Edit panel** interface, click the **Markdown** tab.

The **Markdown** tab contains a text field where you can enter Markdown content. Only
the [functions listed](https://commonmark.org/help/) are supported. Chronosphere
doesn't support all Markdown features, such as color changes for text.

The **Preview** panel updates in real time to display the rendered result.

You can use [dashboard variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables)
in the Markdown contents.

To link to another Chronosphere dashboard:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="link-simple" alt="Link icon"/> Link** tool.
1. Click **Link type** and select **Dashboard**.
1. Click **Select dashboard** and select a dashboard for the link's destination.
1. Optional: Click **Include current time range** to toggle whether the link
   opens the destination dashboard with the same time range as this panel's
   dashboard.
1. Optional: Click **Include current variable values** to toggle whether to
   pass the same [dashboard variable](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables)
   values to the destination dashboard.
1. Click **Insert link** to add the link to the Markdown content.
1. Optional: To cancel without adding a link, click **Cancel**.

To link to an arbitrary URL:

1. Click the **<Icon icon="link-simple" alt="Link icon"/> Link** tool.
1. Enter a **Name** for the link, which the panel uses for the link's text.
1. Enter a **URL** for the link's destination.

   You can include dashboard variables in the URL. Chronosphere includes available
   variables in the link insertion dialog.
1. Click **Insert link** to add the link to the Markdown content.
1. Optional: To cancel without adding a link, click **Cancel**.
