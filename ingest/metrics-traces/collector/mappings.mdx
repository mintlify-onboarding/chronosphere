title: Map data sources to Chronosphere
---
{/* -- dri: Garrett Guillotte -- */}


To display metrics and traces to users, Chronosphere ingests data through the use of
its own [Collector](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector). The Collector supports several metrics
formats.

Use this section to learn more about how to map other metrics formats' data and
functions to Chronosphere:

- [Prometheus](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/mappings/prometheus/prometheus-recommendations) is
  the default for Chronosphere.
- [Datadog](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/mappings/datadog) data can be imported into
  Chronosphere.
- [SignalFx](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/mappings/signalfx) queries work differently than
  PromQL.
- [Wavefront](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/mappings/wavefront) queries work differently than
  PromQL.
