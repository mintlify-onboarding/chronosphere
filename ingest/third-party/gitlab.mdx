To send GitLab events to Chronosphere Observability Platform, create a webhook within
GitLab and include your API key to authenticate with Observability Platform. For more
information, refer to
[Webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html) in the
GitLab documentation.

## Obtain an API token

Before sending events from GitLab, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) to
obtain an API token for use with authenticating your third-party app with
Observability Platform.

<EventsToken />

## Create a GitLab webhook

To send GitLab events to Observability Platform:

1. In GitLab, [create a webhook](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#configure-a-webhook-in-gitlab)
   scoped to your project or group.
1. In the **URL** field, enter
   `https://ADDRESS.chronosphere.io/api/v1/data/events/receiver/gitlab`

   Replace _`ADDRESS`_ with your company name prefixed to your Observability Platform
   instance that ends in `.chronosphere.io`. For example,
   _`MY_COMPANY`_`.chronosphere.io`.
1. In the **Secret token** field, enter the API token you obtained from Chronosphere
   Support.
1. In the **Trigger** section, select the events to trigger the webhook.
   Observability Platform supports only **Deployment events** and
   **Feature flag events**.

   <Warning>
If you choose any events other than **Deployment events** or **Feature flag events**,
   Observability Platform drops the related event data, even though the GitLab interface lets
   you select other event types.
</Warning>

1. Click **Add webhook** to create the webhook.
