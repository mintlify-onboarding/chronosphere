<Note>
To enable change events on service pages, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support).
</Note>

You can enable [change events](/overview/types/change-events) to display them on panels
for each of your services. This capability lets you visualize changes in your
environment relative to a specific service.

To display events on service pages, your organization must meet the following
requirements:

- Your organization must have an active license for the Events product, and the product
   must be active in your tenant.
- Events data must have service names provided on a metric label.
- Service name values for each event must exactly match the service name value used in
  metrics.
- Observability Platform service discovery must be configured and actively
  discovering services.

After enabling change events, you can choose the category of events you want to
display. You can select a single or multiple categories. Clicking a change event from
a panel gives you the option to open the event in Changes Explorer to view the full
summary for that event.

Enabling change events on service panels also adds a **Change Events** table to your
service page that contains a list of events related to the selected service. Clicking
a change event from the table opens a panel for the specific event that displays the
full summary.

To display change events for services:

1. On the [Services](/observe/services) page, click any service's **Name** to open
   the service's detail page.
1. On the service's detail page, click the **Change Events** toggle to enable change
   events for that service.
1. In the **Category** dropdown, select the change event categories you want to
   display on your service panels.
1. In any panel, hold the pointer over a change event to display more details for a
   particular change event.
1. Click the change event to pin it, and then click **View details** to display the
   full [change event details](/observe/enable-events/use-events#change-event-details).
1. In the **Change event** drawer, click **Open in Changes Explorer** to open the
   change event in Changes Explorer with the full summary for that event.

From Changes Explorer, you can [filter](/investigate/querying/filter-events)
specifically on services by including `lens_service` and the name of the service you
want to display. For example, the following filter displays all `deploy` events for
the `auth` service:

```text
lens_service = "auth" AND category = "deploys"
```

Change events also display in a table pages for individual services. The information is
similar to the change events list in
[Changes Explorer](/observe/enable-events/use-events#view-change-events),
but is filtered to the selected service.
