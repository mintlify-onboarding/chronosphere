title: Querying metrics about alerts
---
{/* -- dri: Adam Locke -- */}


In addition to monitors and alerts, you can query metrics for any triggered series.
The series are all under a single metric name `ALERTS` that you can query with PromQL
as normal. The series contain metadata such as `alertname`, `alertstate`, and `severity`.

The value for these is only ever `1`, which occurs when triggering the alert, or
the alert is in a pending state. When the alert is in a passing state, the series
isn't emitted.

For example, the following monitor definition emits a corresponding series with the
value of `1` when triggering the alert:

## Definition

```yaml
monitors:
  - name: Errors per second
    labels:
      - name: priority
        value: sev-0
      - name: team
        value:
    spec:
      query:
        prometheus:
          expr: sum(rate(fetch_errors{code="4XX"}[1m]))
      series_conditions:
        defaults:
          critical:
            conditions:
              - op: GEQ
                value: 1
                sustain: 180s
```

## Metric

```text
ALERTS{alertname="Errors per second", alertstate="firing", code="4XX", priority="sev-0", team="A"}
```

The labels attached to this special `ALERTS` metric are a combination of the labels
from the alerting time series and the labels defined in the `labels` section of
the monitor specification.

Annotations, if defined, aren't included as part of the labels, and labels in the
`labels` configuration override any labels on the metric itself. For example, if
there's a `job` label on the alerting time series and a `job` label defined in the
alert definition, the alert definition label takes priority.
