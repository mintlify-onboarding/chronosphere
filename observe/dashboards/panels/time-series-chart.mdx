A _time series chart_ visualizes time series data returned by a
[query](/investigate/querying). The chart depicts each returned time series as either
a line or bar chart representing each data point or interval, with time depicted
along the X axis and values along the Y axis. Time series charts are the default
panel type when creating new panels in Chronosphere Observability Platform.

Use time series charts to analyze trends and patterns in data over spans of time.
For example, you can render time series data about a service's resource consumption
to identify points in time where unexpected demand exhausted capacity and reduced
the service's performance or availability.

When combined with other charts in a [dashboard](/observe/dashboards), you can focus
on that point in time and correlate the event with other time series visualizations.
Dashboards also support [variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables)
that can dynamically replace values in the panel and its query with those defined
by the dashboard's editor and selected by its viewers.

To create a time series chart or learn more about the configuration options common
to all panels, see [Panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).

## Use a time series chart's tooltip

When you hold the pointer over a time series's line or bar, Observability Platform
displays a tooltip that includes the date and time where the cursor is pointing. The
tooltip also displays the value of that series at that point in time. If multiple
series are under the cursor, Observability Platform displays the values for each
series. Moving the cursor along the series updates the values in the tooltip to the
new point in time.

To configure which series Observability Platform includes in the tooltip, see
[Modify a time series chart's tooltip](#modify-a-time-series-charts-tooltip).

In time series bar charts, certain data points display a time value such as `2h` to
indicate the step size.

### Pin a point in time

To pin the tooltip to a specific point in time, click the chart. The tooltip remains
visible until you click **Unpin <Icon icon="xmark" alt="Close icon"/>** inside
the tooltip. Next to any time series, click the <Icon icon="expand" />
expand icon to open the graph in an overlay window, filtered to that time series.

#### Add an annotation

You can add an annotation when a specific time is pinned. To do so:

1. [Pin](#pin-a-point-in-time) a data point.
1. In the tooltip box, click **+ Create annotation event**.
1. Add **Event Details**.

   - **Title**: The event title.
   - **Timestamp**: By default, this field is pre-populated with the pinned time.
     Event creation is limited to either 24 hours in the past or 24 hours into the
     future from the current time.
   - **Category**: The event's category. Select from the drop down list.
   - **Source**: Select an event source from the drop down list.
   - **Type**: Select the event type from the drop down list.
1. Add **Event Labels**. Event labels consist of **Key** and **Value** pairs. Select
   a **Key** from its drop down list and then select a **Value**. For example, a
   default pair is includes the **Key** `user_email` and the **Value** field
   populates with the signed in user's email address.
1. To add additional labels, click **+ Add Label**.
1. To delete a label, click the <Icon path= {mdiTrashCan} /> trash can.
1. When finished, click **Add Event**.

## Time series chart queries

Time series charts use one or more
[queries](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-query) to retrieve data to
visualize.

Time series charts use the following query **Options** to refine the
displayed information, depending on your **Datasource**:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Metrics (Prometheus)">

- <DashboardSeriesNaming />
- **Min step**: The step parameter of the PromQL query.
<DashboardDownsampleTruncate />

</Tab>
<Tab title="Graphite">

Graphite doesn't have additional query options.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Logs">

<DashboardSeriesNaming />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure a time series chart

You can configure a time series chart by
[modifying its **Settings**](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).

Any changes you make in the panel's **Settings** tab are immediately reflected in
the **Preview** pane but take effect only when you click **Apply** in the **Edit panel**
interface and then **Save** the dashboard.

Observability Platform doesn't fully support directly editing a panel's JSON
representation and recommends configuring panels in the user interface. Use the JSON
representation only for managing your configuration as code with tools such as
[Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) and [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform).

Several time series chart options use
[regular expressions](/investigate/querying/regular-expressions).

### Modify a time series chart's colors

The **Advanced** tab in a time series chart's **Edit Panel** interface contains
an **Overrides** section where you can add, remove, and configure color overrides.
You can apply color overrides to a specific series or all series that match a regular
expression.

To add a color override:

1. Click the plus sign (+) in the **Override** section header.
1. In the field that appears, select whether you want the override to select a series
   based on the **series name** or a **series name with a matching regex**.
1. Enter the series name or regular expression to override.
1. Click **Add property**, then click **Color**.
1. Optional: Repeat these steps to create additional color overrides.

To delete a color override, click the
**<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete** icon on its corresponding
row of the Overrides section.

### Modify a time series line style

You can modify the style of line displayed in a time series chart.

1. Click the plus sign (+) in the **Override** section header.
1. In the field that appears, select whether you want the override to select a series
   based on the **series name** or a **series name with a matching regex**.
1. Enter the series name or regular expression to override.
1. Click **Add property**, then click **Line style**.
1. Select **Solid** (default) or **Dashed**.
1. Optional: Repeat these steps to add line styles to additional time series.
1. Click **Apply**.

To delete a line style override, click the
**<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete** icon on its
corresponding row of the Overrides section.

### Modify a time series chart's legend

The **Legend** section in a time series chart's **Settings** tab controls whether
to display a legend alongside the chart, and if so it also configures where and
how it appears.

- **Show**: Toggles whether to display the legend. Defaults to disabled.
- **Position**: Selects whether to display the legend **Below** or to the **Right**
  of the chart. Defaults to `Below`.
- **Mode**: Selects whether to display the legend as a **List** of time series with
  a color swatch associating it with a line or bar on the chart, or as a **Table**
  with a header row. Defaults to `List`.
- **Size**: Defines the legend's size relative to the chart as either **Small**
  or **Medium**. Defaults to `Small`.
- **Values**: Toggles whether to display certain values for each time series, such
  as its average, minimum, maximum, and total values, in the legend. Defaults to
  showing no values.
  - **Avg**: The series' mean value, excluding null values.
  - **First**: The series' first value.
  - **First \***: The series' first numeric value.
  - **Last**: The series' last value.
  - **Last \***: The series' last numeric value.
  - **Min**: The series' minimum value.
  - **Max**: The series' maximum value.
  - **Total**: The sum of all values in the series.

  Units, abbreviations, and decimal places configured in the **Unit and Formatting**
  settings also apply here.

### Modify a time series chart's visual representation

The **Visual** section in a time series chart's **Settings** tab controls how
Observability Platform visualizes the query's time series results in the chart.

- **Display**: Toggles whether to visualize the data as a **Line** or **Bar** chart.
  Defaults to `line`.
- **Line Width**: Defines the series' width in pixels. In the Settings tab, use
  the slider to define a value between 0 and 3. Defaults to `1.5`.
- **Area Opacity**: Defines the opacity of the space beneath each line, from fully
  transparent (`0`) to fully opaque (`1`). The fill color for each series is the
  same as its line or bar color. Defaults to `0`.
- **Stack Series**: Determines how to display the values for a series. Choose one
  of the following values:
  - `None`: Display each series' value independently. Default.
  - `All`: Display series' values stacked cumulatively on top of each other.
  - `Percent`: Display series' values by relative percentage to help show the
    proportions of each series change over time.
- **Color Palette**: Determines the chart's color palette. The **Classic** palette
  uses six colors and prioritizes readability. The **Consistent** palette
  includes more colors and lets you assign a color to a series consistently across
  multiple panels. The **Status-neutral** palette excludes red, orange, and green
  to help distinguish between the chart's values and status indicators. Defaults to **Classic**.
- **Show Points**: Determines whether to render data points as dots on the chart.
  `Auto` renders data points only if doing so doesn't degrade browser performance.
  `Always` and `Never` respectively render or hide data points regardless of the
  number of data points. Defaults to `Auto`.
- **Null Behavior**: Determines how to chart data points with null values. To connect
  points in a Line chart even if there are null values between data points, select
  `Connected`. To treat null values as zeroes, select `Null as zero`. Defaults to
  `Auto`, which disconnects the series in a Line chart if any points are null.

### Modify time series units and formatting

The **Unit and formatting** section changes the display of units on the chart.

<DashboardUnits />

### Modify a time series chart's Y axis

The **Y axis** section in a time series chart's **Settings** tab controls whether
Observability Platform renders a chart's Y axis, and if so what information it
includes.

These settings apply to all values on the chart regardless of time series, and
includes any values you enabled in the chart's legend.

- **Show**: Toggles whether to show the Y axis on the chart. Defaults to `true`.
- **Label**: Renders the given text vertically next to the Y axis. Defaults to no
  value.
- **Min** and **Max**: Define the minimum and maximum values, respectively, to render
  on the chart. Observability Platform doesn't render values smaller than the minimum
  or larger than the maximum. Defaults to no value, which dynamically changes the
  axis's range to display all data.

#### Add a second Y axis

You can create a series override in a time series chart's **Advanced** tab that
adds a second Y axis for the chart. Use this to indicate the scale and units of
a second series in a single time series chart.

To create an override that adds a right Y axis:

1. Click the plus sign (+) in the **Override** section header.
1. In the field that appears, select whether you want the override to select a series
   based on the **series name** or a **series name with a matching regex**.
1. Enter the series name or regular expression to override.
1. Click **Add property**, then click **Right y-axis**.
1. Configure the right Y axis, which has the same settings available as the primary
   left Y axis.

To delete a right Y axis, click the
**<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete** icon on its corresponding
row of the Overrides section.

### Modify a time series chart's tooltip

The **Tooltip** section in a time series chart's **Settings** tab determines whether
to render a tooltip when you move the cursor over the chart and which time series
it displays.

The **Mode** toggle has three available states, which you can toggle by clicking
them:

| Single | Nearby | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| On     | Off    | The tooltip appears only when the cursor is near a charted time series, and it contains only the time series closest to the cursor. Enabling Single sets Nearby to Off. |
| Off    | On     | The tooltip appears only when the cursor is near a charted time series, and the tooltip contains all nearby time series. This is the default state of a new time series chart. Enabling Nearby sets Single to Off. |
| Off    | Off    | The tooltip appears whenever you move the cursor over the chart and displays all time series with data at the point in time represented under the cursor. |

Regardless of this setting's value, the tooltip and chart always highlight the time
series directly beneath the cursor.

### Modify a time series chart's thresholds

The **Thresholds** section in a chart's **Settings** tab defines values
where Observability Platform renders threshold lines over the chart. You can define
threshold values as either absolute numeric values or percentiles. Observability
Platform renders threshold lines as dashed lines.

The threshold's **Mode** defines whether all thresholds use **Absolute** numeric
values, which is the default mode, or **Percent** values. Percent values are relative
to the Y axis' minimum and maximum.

To create a new threshold:

1. Click the plus sign (+) in the **Thresholds** section header.
1. In the field that appears, enter a value where you want Observability Platform to
   render the threshold line.
1. Optional: Click the color indicator, depicted as a colored circle, to open a
   color selector and choose a color for the threshold line.
1. Optional: Click the caret (>) to expand the threshold definition, and enter text
   in the **Label** field to display on the chart if the threshold is met. This
   text displays when you hold the pointer over the area of the chart exceeding the
   threshold.

   Drag the **Area opacity** slider to highlight the background of the area exceeding
   the threshold.

1. In the **Edit panel** dialog, click **Apply** to save your changes.
1. After you've finished editing the panel, click **Save** on the dashboard to save
   your changes.

To delete a threshold line, click the caret (>) to expand the threshold definition,
and then click the **<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete** icon
on its corresponding row of the Thresholds section.
