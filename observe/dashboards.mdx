Use dashboards to analyze your metrics by creating visualizations of query results
that you can customize, filter, and focus. You can use this to identify and act on
trends, correlate changes in data to incidents, and monitor real-time statuses.

Chronosphere Observability Platform provides two types of dashboards:

- Standard dashboards, documented on this page
- [Classic dashboards](/observe/dashboards/classic-dashboards), based on Grafana

Standard dashboards are purpose-built for observability with Observability Platform,
and are the only dashboards with a commitment to ongoing development.

<Info>
Standard dashboards aren't available to all Observability Platform users and might
not be visible in your app. For information about enabling this feature in your
environment, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support).
</Info>

Dashboards are individual pages made up of [panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).
These panels can be [different types](/observe/dashboards/panels#panel-types),
depending on the data or text you want to visualize. Dashboards have many
customization options to help you focus on and group the information you need.

## View dashboards

Select from the following methods to view your available dashboards.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="view-dashboards-cloud">

To search for a dashboard from anywhere in Observability Platform:

1. Click the global search bar to focus on it, or use the keyboard shortcut
   `Control+K` (`Command+K` on macOS).
1. Click the **<Icon icon="dashboard" alt="Dashboard icon"/> Dashboards**
   filter.
1. Begin typing any part of the dashboard's name.
1. Click a dashboard listed in the search results to view it, or use the arrow keys
   to select the result and press `Enter` (`Return` on macOS).

To view all dashboards, in the navigation menu select
**<Icon icon="dashboard" alt="Dashboards"/> Dashboards**. This displays
a table listing every dashboard in your organization.

In the table's **Owner** column, the <CollectionIcon /> collection icon indicates a
dashboard is part of a [collection](/administer/collections). The <ServiceIcon />
service icon indicates a dashboard is part of a [service](/observe/services).

The table's **Type** column indicates whether the dashboard is a
[classic](/observe/dashboards/classic-dashboards) or standard dashboard.

The table's **Source** column indicates how your organization manages each dashboard
as an Observability Platform resource. Dashboards managed in Observability Platform
or with [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) list no source, and you can manage and modify them
with either the app or Chronoctl. You **must** manage dashboards created in
[Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform) with Terraform.

You can toggle the visibility of columns and pin selected columns to the left or
right sides of the table by holding the pointer over the column and clicking
the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" alt="Settings icon"/> column settings icon.

You can also filter the table's contents to display only those with certain names
or properties.

{/* vale off */}

- To filter the table's contents by name, enter part or all of a dashboard name
  into the **Search dashboards <Icon icon="magnifying-glass" alt="Search icon"/>** field.
- To filter the table by team or owner, select their name from their respective
  **Select a team** and **Select an owner** dropdowns or enter part or all of their
  name into the fields to filter the dropdown options.
- To filter the table by tag, click **Select a tag** and select its name from the
  suggestion list, or enter part or all of a tag name into the field to filter the
  list. Only classic dashboards support tags.
- To filter the table to display only your
  [favorite dashboards](#designate-your-favorite-dashboards), click the
  **View only my favorites** toggle.
- **Include connected dashboards**: If you filter dashboards by owner while the
  toggle is disabled, you'll only get dashboards owned by that owner. When the toggle
  is enabled, your filter includes dashboards that are connected to that owner, even
  if they aren't owned by that owner. Connections are based on
  [collections](/administer/collections/home).

{/* vale on */}

  Observability Platform displays your favorite dashboards and those you have
  recently opened on your personal home page. Your favorite dashboards also appear
  first in global search results.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="view-dashboards-chronoctl">

To return a list of all dashboards with [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl), use the
`chronoctl dashboards list` command:

```shell
chronoctl dashboards list
```

You can list specific dashboards by name or slug by
passing a comma-delimited list to the `--names` or `--slugs` flags, respectively. For
example:

```shell
chronoctl dashboards list --names LIST
```

Replace _`LIST`_ with a comma-separated list of dashboard names as a string, such as
`"Infra Dashboard,Frontend Dashboard"`.

<Info>
Dashboard resources returned by `list` don't contain the dashboard's JSON definitions
by default, but resources returned by `read` do. To include dashboard JSON with
`dashboards list`, add the `--include-dashboard-json` option to the command:

```shell
chronoctl dashboards list --include-dashboard-json
```
</Info>

To return a single dashboard, use the `chronoctl dashboards read` command:

```shell
chronoctl dashboards read SLUG
```

Replace _`SLUG`_ with the dashboard's slug.

</Tab>
<Tab title="API" id="view-dashboards-api">

### View Chronosphere-managed dashboards

Observability Platform includes several dashboards to visualize information about
itself and its usage within your organization. For more information, see
[Chronosphere-managed dashboards](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards).

## Create or import a dashboard

To add a dashboard, you can:

- [Create a new dashboard](#create-a-new-dashboard).
- [Duplicate an existing dashboard](#duplicate-a-dashboard).
- [Import a classic dashboard](#import-a-classic-dashboard).

### Create a new dashboard

Select from the following methods to create a new dashboard. You can create a
dashboard in the Observability Platform web interface, or define the
dashboard [in code](/tooling/gitops#use-the-code-config-tool) and upload it. See the
[dashboard configuration schema](/tooling/api-info/dashboard_schema) for help
defining fields in code.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="create-a-dashboard-cloud">

<Info>
These steps apply only to standard dashboards. For classic dashboards, see
[Classic dashboards](/observe/dashboards/classic-dashboards).
</Info>

To create a new dashboard:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="dashboard" alt="Dashboards"/> Dashboards**.
1. Click **+ Add**.
1. In the menu that appears, click **New dashboard** to open the **Add dashboard**
   dialog.
1. Enter a descriptive name in the **Dashboard name** field.
1. Enter an **Owner** in the corresponding fields to associate the dashboard with
   a [Collection](/administer/collections) or [Service](/observe/services).
1. Optional: Enter **Tags** in the corresponding field to associate the dashboard
   with key/value tag pairs.
1. Click **Save**.

You can also create a new dashboard from an
[existing panel](/observe/dashboards/panels#copy-a-panel-to-another-dashboard),
[duplicate an existing dashboard](#duplicate-a-dashboard), or
[import a JSON file](#import-a-dashboard-with-json).

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="create-a-dashboard-chronoctl">

To create a new dashboard using [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl), configure it in a YAML
resource definition and apply it.

<Info>
If you don't already have a YAML configuration file, use the
`chronoctl dashboards scaffold` command to generate a template for a specific
resource type:

```shell
chronoctl dashboards scaffold
```

You can redirect the results (using the redirection operator `>`) to a file for
editing.
</Info>

To create a new dashboard as code:

1. Configure the dashboard by editing the resource's properties. Remove any properties
   you don't want to configure.

   Define the dashboard within the YAML resource as a block of JSON. You can retrieve
   the JSON of an existing dashboard from Observability Platform by navigating to
   the dashboard and clicking the **<Icon icon="download" /> Download JSON**
   button.

   For example, this resource creates an empty dashboard with the name `Infra Dashboard`
   and slug `infra-dashboard`:

   ```yaml
   api_version: v1/config
   kind: Dashboard
   spec:
     # Unique identifier of the Dashboard. If slug is not provided, one will be
     # generated based of the name field. Cannot be modified after the Dashboard
     # is created.
     slug: "infra-dashboard"
     # Required name of the Dashboard. May be modified after the Dashboard is created.
     name: "Infra Dashboard"
     # Required raw JSON of the dashboard.
     dashboard_json: >
       {
         "kind": "Dashboard",
         "metadata": {
           "name": "Infra dashboard"
         },
         "spec": {
           "events": [],
           "panels": {},
           "layouts": [],
           "variables": [],
           "duration": "30m"
         }
       }
     # Required collection associated with this dashboard.
     collection_slug: "infra-collection"
   ```

1. Apply the changes:

   ```shell
   chronoctl apply -f FILE_NAME.yaml
   ```

   Replace _`FILE_NAME`_ with the name of your notifier YAML file.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Terraform" id="create-a-dashboard-terraform">

To create a dashboard with [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform):

1. Create or edit a Terraform file that updates the resource's existing properties.
   You can [export the configuration](/observe/dashboards#export-a-dashboard) of an
   existing dashboard and edit it to create a new dashboard.
1. Run this command to apply the changes:

   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

</Tab>
<Tab title="API" id="create-a-dashboard-api">

To complete this action with the Chronosphere API, use the
[`CreateDashboard`](/tooling/api-info/definition/operations/CreateDashboard) endpoint.

<ApiAuthReq />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

After creating a dashboard, you can populate it with
[panels](/observe/dashboards/panels), add and edit
[dashboard variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables) and
events, and configure its [layouts](/observe/dashboards/customization/layouts). You
can also associate Services to dashboards by using either Chronoctl or Terraform.

### Duplicate a dashboard

You can duplicate dashboards, including in Observability Platform, and then customize
the duplicate. Chronosphere-managed dashboards can be duplicated but not deleted.

1. In the **Dashboards** page, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three
   vertical dots icon and then click **Duplicate**.

   Alternately, when viewing a dashboard, click
   **Settings**  <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Duplicate dashboard**.
1. Enter the following information:
   - **Dashboard name**: A name for the new dashboard.
   - **Owner**: The service or collection that owns this dashboard.
   - Optional: Select tags for the dashboard.
1. Click **Save**.

Your duplicated dashboard opens and is ready to edit.

### Import a dashboard with JSON

Observability Platform lets you upload one or more dashboards as JSON files.
To do so:

1. In the navigation menu select **<Icon icon="dashboard" /> Dashboards**.
1. Click **+ Add**.
1. In the menu, click **Import dashboard** to open the **Import Dashboards** dialog.
1. Click **Import or Drag and Drop dashboard JSON File** to upload one or more exported
   dashboard JSON files, or drag and drop a dashboard JSON into the
   **Import Dashboard JSON** field.

   If the file fails validation, the dialog displays an error message that
   describes the failure.

   There is one entry for each uploaded file.
1. In the **Upload Settings** section, select an **Owner** for the dashboard to
   associate the dashboard with a [collection](/administer/collections) or
   [service](/observe/services).
1. Optional: Add a **Tag**.
1. Optional: Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. The field default is
   the import file's name.
1. Optional: Enter **Tags** in the corresponding field to associate the dashboard
   with key/value tag pairs.
1. Click **Import Dashboards** to import the dashboard.

When complete, the dialog displays a `Dashboard uploaded` success message.

#### Import a classic dashboard

You can [import a Grafana dashboard as a classic dashboard](/observe/dashboards/classic-dashboards/import-grafana-dashboards)
with Chronoctl or Terraform.

## Designate your favorite dashboards

You can designate certain dashboards as your [favorites](/navigate/favorites).
Observability Platform lists your favorite dashboards on your personal home page
and prioritizes them in global search results.

## Modify a dashboard's layout

Dashboard _layouts_ help you organize related [panels](/observe/dashboards/panels)
into panel groups.

For more information, see
[Organize dashboard content with layouts](/observe/dashboards/customization/layouts).

## View and compare specific time ranges

_Comparison mode_, sometimes called week-over-week (WoW) view, helps you overlay
historical data on your current data in dashboards. This provides additional context
for comparing your current metrics with historical trends and expectations, or
identifying recurring trends and outliers.

For details about using comparison mode, see
[Manage dashboard time ranges](/observe/dashboards/customization/time-ranges).

## Query Accelerator

To help reduce the impact of slow queries on Dashboard performance, Observability
Platform automatically optimizes queries. The optimization process detects slow
aggregation queries in dashboard panels, creates pre-aggregated time series to
reflect those rollups, and replaces the slow results with the optimized results at
query time.
