Chronosphere Observability Platform identifies users and services by their
_accounts_. As an administrator, you can organize accounts into _teams_ and define
those teams' permissions.

- A [_user account_](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts)
  represents a user's identity in Observability Platform.
- A [_service account_](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts)
  represents a service's identity in Observability Platform.
- A [_team_](/administer/accounts-teams/teams) organizes accounts into
  groups and defines permissions for sensitive management and administrative
  operations.

Add accounts to teams based on the permissions you want grant to those accounts. For
example, to make a user or service account an _administrator_, assign it to a team
that has the SysAdmin role. This grants the account access to special Observability
Platform features, including team and account management and assignment.

## View accounts and teams

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web - accounts" id="view-accounts-cloud">

In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin** and then select
**<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Users**.

The left-hand column lists all accounts. The list includes icons for
additional context about each entry type:

| Icon                                      | Description |
| :---------------------------------------: | ----------- |
| <Icon icon="user" />             | An active user account. |
| <Icon icon="robot" />              | A service account. |
| <Icon icon="circle-minus" /> | An invited user who's yet to confirm their account. |
| <Icon icon="circle-xmark" /> | A deactivated user account. |

A <Icon icon="key" /> **System Administrator** icon to the right of an entry
indicates either a team that has the System Administrator (SysAdmin) role, or
a user or service account that's a member of a team with that role.

To view details about an account, select its name from the list. To filter by
account name, enter part or all of the account's name in the **Search** field.
To filter by account type or status, click the <Icon icon="filter" />
filter icon.

When you select an account, Observability Platform displays the account's team
**Memberships** and **Recent User Actions**.

If your user account belongs to a team with the SysAdmin role, this view also
provides options to add or remove the account from teams.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Web - teams" id="view-accounts-cloud">

In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin** and then select
**<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Teams**.

The table lists all teams by name and other details about their configuration:

- **Role**: The role granted to all accounts in the team. The SysAdmin role
  grants administrative privileges.
- **Source**: The source of this team's configuration. **UI** teams are
  configured in Observability Platform and can be edited in the app by users with
  the SysAdmin role. **Terraform** teams are configured exclusively through
  Terraform.
- **Description**: A description of the team.

To view a team's [home page](/administer/collections/home), click
its name in the list. If your user account is part of a team with the SysAdmin
role, you can edit the team's name, role, description, links, and membership
from its home page.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl" id="view-accounts-and-teams-chronoctl">

You can use [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) to list teams and their member accounts.
This output includes the email address associated with each account. If an account's
email address is an alphanumeric Observability Platform
slug at the `serviceaccount.chronosphere.io` domain, that
member is a [service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts). Other
email addresses represent user accounts.

<Info>
To view accounts and teams with Chronoctl, you must authenticate as a user
that belongs to a team with the SysAdmin role, or as an unrestricted
[service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts).
</Info>

To list each team and its member accounts in separate YAML documents with
[Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl), use the `teams list` command. You can also use
this output as a template for updating each team separately using Chronoctl.

```shell
chronoctl teams list
```

The output contains YAML documents separated by three dashes (`---`). Each document
contains one team and any of its member accounts.

For example, this output lists a team named _Control team_ with one user account
and one service account as members, and a second team named _DBAs_ with two
user account members:

```yaml
api_version: v1/config
kind: Team
spec:
  slug: control-team
  name: Control team
  user_emails:
    - adam@example.com
    - 4a5842df-4179-47c7-bcc0-d1e6589caaf0@serviceaccount.chronosphere.io
---
api_version: v1/config
kind: Team
spec:
  slug: dbas
  name: DBAs
  user_emails:
    - adam@example.com
    - betty@example.com
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="API" id="list-teams-api">

To list all teams with the Chronosphere API, use the
[`ListTeams`](https://docs.chronosphere.io/tooling/api-info/definition/operations/ListTeams) endpoint.

To view a single team, use the
[`ReadTeams`](https://docs.chronosphere.io/tooling/api-info/definition/operations/ReadTeams) endpoint.

## Grant System Administrator (SysAdmin) privileges to a team

A user account that's a member of a [team](/administer/accounts-teams/teams) with
the `SysAdmin` role has administrative access to Observability Platform features,
including the abilities to create teams and user accounts, assign users to teams,
and define team permissions.

For instructions about assigning roles to a team, see
[Add a role to a team](/administer/accounts-teams/teams#add-a-role-to-a-team).
