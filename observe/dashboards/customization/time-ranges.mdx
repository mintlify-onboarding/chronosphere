Use a dashboard's _time range_ to analyze visualized data in multiple
[panels](/observe/dashboards/panels). You can define a refresh interval to control
how frequently the dashboard updates panel data. You can also select a
[time range](/navigate/time-ranges) to view the same period across all of a
dashboard's panels to help you correlate events. You can also compare current data
to past data to identify trends.

## Set a dashboard's refresh interval

To manually refresh a dashboard's panels, click the **<Icon icon="rotate" /> Refresh**
button in the dashboard.

To set how often a dashboard refreshes its panels:

1. Click the refresh dropdown, which defaults to **Off**.
1. Click an interval in the list, or **Off** to disable automatic refreshing.

## Define a dashboard's time range

You can define a dashboard's time range by using the
**<Icon icon="clock" /> time range selector**, or by selecting part of
a data visualization within a panel.

### Define a dashboard's time range with the time range selector

The **<Icon icon="clock" /> time range selector** is a dropdown menu
and text-entry field that provides several ways to define a relative or absolute
time range. For details about time ranges in Observability Platform and
time range selector usage, see [Select time ranges](/navigate/time-ranges).

### Select a dashboard's time range from a panel

You can also define a time range by selecting it inside of a data visualization
chart panel.

To select a time range:

1. In any of the dashboard's chart visualizations, click the beginning or end point
   in time for the range you want to define.
1. Drag to the point at the other end of the time range.
   Chronosphere masks the area between in gray to visualize the range that you've
   selected.

Upon releasing the cursor, the dashboard updates all of its panels to display the
selected time range.

### Pin a time range

You can pin dashboard time ranges to the last selected interval, or to a relative
time period. When a time range is pinned, all dashboards respect the pinned interval.
This lets you review multiple dashboards while using the same time range, enabling
comparison of the same time period.

1. In the [time range selector](/navigate/time-ranges#use-the-time-range-selector),
   click the <Icon icon="thumbtack" /> Pin icon.
1. Select a pin option:
   - **Pin with absolute time range**: Pins a specific time interval. If you're
     viewing a dashboard and don't want it to refresh, pin it.
   - **Pin with relative time range**: Pins the last selected interval. For example,
     if your time selector uses **Last 30 minutes**, the relative range is the last
     30 minutes.

When a time range is pinned, the pin is green.

To unpin the time range, click the <Icon icon="thumbtack" style={{ color: 'rgb(89, 204, 141)' }}/> pin again.

## Compare current data to past data

Comparison mode, sometimes called week-over-week view, is a Chronosphere
feature that overlays historical data on your current data in dashboards. This
feature provides additional context for comparing your current metrics with historical
trends and expectations, or identifying recurring trends and outliers.

To compare current data to past data:

1. Click **Compare**.
1. Select a past period to overlay onto the dashboard's panels.

   The **Preceding period** option overlays the immediately preceding period of the same
   length as the selected time range.

   An additional query runs to pull historical ("offset") time series into your graph,
   which returns data with the same resolution as your current data.

   Depending on the time period you select and your data retention settings, the
   result might include a gap for your most recent data, such as the last 10 minutes.

   Chronosphere matches the current and historical data queries using tag logic, with
   `_offset_:true` on the offset query and `_series_:series<num>` for all of the
   series. This associates data from the offset time series to the current series for
   similar presentation, so the results in comparison mode contain labels that
   resemble `__chrono_offset__: offset_7d1h` or `__chrono_series__: "series1"`.

[Chronosphere blog](https://chronosphere.io/learn/how-to-monitor-week-over-week-trends-in-chronosphere/).

To disable the overlay, click **Compare** and select **Off**.
