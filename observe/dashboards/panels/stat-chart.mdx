A _stat chart_ visualizes statistic numbers returned by a
[query](/investigate/querying). The chart depicts a value based on the results of the
defined query. You can optionally add a sparkline chart that displays under the
value, in addition to displaying a message when the value hits a defined threshold.

To create a Stat chart or learn more about the configuration options common
to all panels, see [Panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).

## Stat chart queries

Stat charts use one or more
[queries](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-query) to retrieve data to
visualize. Stat charts use the following query **Options** to refine the
displayed information, depending on your **Datasource**:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Metrics (Prometheus)">

- <DashboardSeriesNaming />
- **Type**: The [PromQL query](/investigate/querying/promql#basic-querying)
  type: **Instant**, or **Range**.
- **Reduce values in timeframe to**:
  - **Avg**: The series' mean value, excluding null values.
  - **First**: The series' first value.
  - **First \***: The series' first numeric value.
  - **Last**: The series' last value.
  - **Last \***: The series' last numeric value.
  - **Min**: The series' minimum value.
  - **Max**: The series' maximum value.
  - **Total**: The total all values in the series.

## Configure a stat chart

You can configure a stat chart by
[modifying its **Settings**](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).

Any changes you make in the panel's **Settings** tab are immediately reflected in the
**Preview** pane, but take effect only when you click **Apply** in the **Edit panel**
interface and then **Save** the dashboard.

See [Modify a stat chart's properties](#modify-a-stat-charts-properties) for a list
of the settings you can modify.

Observability Platform doesn't fully support directly editing a panel's JSON
representation and recommends configuring panels in the user interface. Use the JSON
representation only for managing your configuration as code with tools such as
[Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) and [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform).

### Modify a stat chart's properties

The **Misc** section in a table's **Settings** tab defines how the stat interprets
and displays the panel's query results.

- **Sparkline**: Enables a sparkline visualization that displays under the value
  generated by the defined query.
- **Font size**: Controls the size of the font for the displayed value.
- **Series Name**: Controls whether or not the time series name displays.

### Modify a stat chart's units and formatting

The **Unit and formatting** section changes the display of units on the chart.

<DashboardUnits />

### Modify a stat chart's thresholds

The **Thresholds** section in a stat chart's **Settings** tab defines values where
Observability Platform renders each threshold range. You can define threshold values
for stat charts as absolute numeric values.

You can enter a message in the **Base settings** section to display in the panel,
without defining a threshold. You're able to enter an independent message for each
threshold you define.

To create a new threshold value:

1. Click the plus sign (+) in the **Thresholds** section header.
1. In the field that displays, enter a value where you want Observability Platform to
   end the previous threshold range and begin the next range.
1. Optional: Click the color indicator, depicted as a colored square with text, to
   open a color selector and choose a color for the threshold.
1. Optional: Click the caret (>) to expand the threshold definition, and enter text
   in the **Message** field to display on the chart if the threshold is met.

   To display only the text from the **Message** field, click the
   **Show only message** toggle.

1. In the **Edit panel** dialog, click **Apply** to save your changes.
1. After you've finished editing the panel, click **Save** on the dashboard to save
   your changes.

To delete a threshold value, click the caret (>) to expand the threshold definition,
and then click the
**<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete** icon on its corresponding
row of the Thresholds section.
