Chronosphere Observability Platform includes several distinct components, utilities,
and features that give you insight into your telemetry data. This guide describes some
of the most common concepts you'll encounter while using Observability Platform.

## Control Plane

Use the Chronosphere [_Control Plane_](/control) to analyze and shape your telemetry
data to control costs and improve performance. Keep the telemetry data you need to
control costs and configure rules to drop the rest.

- **Metrics data**: Analyze your [traffic](/investigate/analyze/telemetry-analyzer) and
  [usage](/investigate/analyze/usage) to identify opportunities to reduce the
  overall volume of metrics and understand the impact of proposed
  [shaping rules](/control/shaping).
- **Trace data**: Use [sampling](/control/sampling),
  [datasets](/control/sampling/datasets), and
  [behaviors](/control/sampling/behaviors) to manage the trace data you keep and
  discard to help control costs and maximize usefulness.
- **Log data**: Use [datasets](/control/consumption/datasets) to map sets of logs to
  named groups in your organization, and then define
  [budgets](/control/consumption/budgeting) to assign percentages of your license
  consumption to each dataset.

## Unified platform

Observability Platform incorporates all of your telemetry data in a single platform
so you can act on trends, correlate changes to incidents, and monitor status in real
time, all from a single location.

- [_Chronosphere Lens_](/observe/services) gives you visibility into the health and
  performance of your applications by ingesting metrics, traces, and change events.
- [_Dashboards_](/observe/dashboards) are a visual representation of your telemetry
  data that you can customize, filter, and focus on
  [query results](/investigate/querying) to gain greater context of an issue.

## Monitors and services

To reduce downtime and fix issues efficiently, you need to view the full picture of
connected microservices and reduce your mean time to repair (MTTR).

[_Monitors_](/investigate/alerts/monitors) are a set of watch criteria that generates an
[alert](/investigate/alerts) when those criteria are met. Create monitors to track the status of
various conditions, like capacity, uptime, and error rates, and then determine
whether a given condition is passing, failing, or critically failing.

[_Services_](/observe/services) are the smallest measurable unit that emits telemetry
data, such as a microservice, feature, or endpoint. Use services to determine
potential issues, and apply that context across several
[exploration tools](/investigate) to analyze metric, trace, log, and event data.

A [_collection_](/administer/collections) is a group of resources associated with
a service. These resources include [dashboards](/observe/dashboards) and
[monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors). Services are a special type of collection.
