description: Use the Recommendations page to identify and reduce metrics and labels with no usage or utility over the past 30 days.

Chronosphere Observability Platform includes a **Recommendations** page as part of
the Control Plane to help identify metrics and labels with no usage or utility over
the past 30 days. The utility score is calculated based on the number of
configuration references to the metric, such as dashboards or monitors, and direct query
executions, such as in Metrics Explorer.

Use this page to understand the impact on persisted writes and persisted cardinality
when applying the recommended data optimizations. After applying optimizations,
it might take up to 150 minutes to see impacts to cardinality. Impacts to persisted
writes are immediate. The aggregation rules on this page incorporate labels that
appear together in the total cardinality calculation.

## Drop rule recommendations

To apply drop rule recommendations:

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin** and
   then select **<Icon icon="shapes" /> Control <span aria-label="and then">></span> Recommendations**.
1. In the left navigation under **Data optimizations**, click the drop rule
   recommendations.
1. Select one or more metrics to calculate the estimated impact on reducing persisted
   writes and persisted cardinality. All metrics are selected by default.
1. Click **Create Drop Rule** to create a drop rule definition that contains the
   selected metrics.
1. In the **Add Drop Rule** drawer, choose whether the rule drops data with any
   value, or if it meets a particular value.
1. Click **Review** to review your changes.
1. Select the checkbox to indicate that you've reviewed the rule, and then click
   **Save Rule**.

The drop rule is created and displays in the
[Drop Rules](/control/shaping/rules/drop-rules) page.

## Rollup rule recommendations

To apply rollup rule recommendations:

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin** and
   then select **<Icon icon="shapes" /> Control <span aria-label="and then">></span> Recommendations**.
1. In the left navigation under **Data optimizations**, click the rollup rule
   recommendations.
1. Select a single metrics to calculate the estimated impact on reducing persisted
   writes and persisted cardinality.
1. Click **Create Rollup Rule** to create a rollup rule definition that contains the
   selected metric.
1. Complete the steps to
   [create a rollup rule](/control/shaping/rules/rollup#create-a-rollup-rule).
