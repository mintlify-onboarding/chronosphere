You can use Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline to ingest logs from various sources such
as Fluent Bit, Open Telemetry, and HTTP, apply parsers and processing rules, and send
the output to Chronosphere Observability Platform. You create and define a pipeline
in Telemetry Pipeline and set Observability Platform as a destination.

After deploying your pipeline, processed log data streams to Observability Platform
and is available for [exploring and querying](/investigate/querying/query-logs) in Logs
Explorer.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a pipeline, you must [install Telemetry Pipeline](/pipeline-install),
which includes installing a Core Operator and Core Instance.

## Create a pipeline

Specify a source and destination, and apply parsers and processing rules.

To route logs through Telemetry Pipeline to Observability Platform:

1. [Create a pipeline](/pipeline-data/create-modify#create-a-pipeline). Follow the
   steps outlined in the Telemetry Pipeline documentation.
1. Add a source, such as Fluent Bit, Elasticsearch, or OpenTelemetry.
1. Add the [Chronosphere Logs](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins/chronosphere)
   destination.
1. Click the **Chronosphere Logs** destination to edit its configuration:
   1. In the **General** section, in the **Host** field, enter:

      ```text /TENANT/
      TENANT.chronosphere.io
      ```

      Replace _`TENANT`_ with the name of your Observability Platform tenant.

   1. Expand the **Advanced** section, and in the **URI** field, enter:

      ```text
      /api/v1/data/logs/ingest
      ```

1. Complete the remaining steps to deploy your pipeline.

After deploying your pipeline,
[verify that Observability Platform is receiving your logs](/ingest/logs/verify-logs)
as anticipated.
