title: Understand metric quotas and pools
'og:description': Learn about metric quotas and pools, and how to give each pool a specific quota of your total persisted writes license.

{/* -- dri: Adam Locke -- */}


Metric quotas assign specific percentages of your total persisted writes limit to
_pools_ of metrics. A pool might translate to teams or other logical groupings within
your organization.

Use metric quotas to give each pool a specific quota of your total persisted writes
license, expressed either as a percentage or a value in Data Points Per Second
(DPPS).

<Info>
Chronosphere recommends using the fewest number of pools possible for
administrative ease. Ten or fewer pools is adequate for most use cases.

Before adding pools, review concepts about
[defining pools](/control/shaping/quotas/define-pools) to understand how to apply
pool allocations, priorities, and thresholds.

## Exceeding limits

If a metric, single service, pod, or environment begins to emit a high volume of data
that pushes the system over its persisted writes limit, a penalty applies to the pool
containing the emitted metric. Pools that haven't exceeded their quota aren't
penalized.

Individual pool quotas must sum to less than or equal to the
[capacity limit](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#capacity-limits). Metrics
ingestion for individual pools is guaranteed up to the limit defined for the pool. If
your entire Chronosphere Observability Platform tenant is under the capacity limit,
an individual pool can exceed its defined quota without incurring a penalty, and
Observability Platform allocates the remaining capacity to the **Default Pool**.

When a tenant exceeds the overall capacity limit, enforcement rules take effect. How
enforcement occurs differs between licenses:

- **Persisted and matched writes**: When capacity limits are exceeded for persisted
  and matched writes, writes are rate limited based on the defined pools and
  [priority](/control/shaping/quotas/define-pools#configure-priority). Only pools
  that exceed their allocation are penalized. In a penalty state, data is dropped in
  priority order, starting with low-priority data first.
- **Persisted cardinality**: When capacity limits are exceeded for persisted
  cardinality, data is dropped indiscriminately across all pools and priorities until
  the tenant is under the capacity limit.

To control the data that's dropped across pools and priorities for persisted
cardinality, you must configure
[pool thresholds](/control/shaping/quotas/define-pools#pool-thresholds). Thresholds
proactively limit dropped data to specific pools and priorities before overall
capacity is reached. Defining thresholds avoids randomly dropping data, and isolates
penalties so you don't impact pools that aren't exceeding their allocation.
Configuring pool allocations alone doesn't provide protections for persisted
cardinality.

Thresholds define limits that prevent series from consuming portions of the overall
cardinality budget and inadvertently affecting pools that haven't exceeded their
allocation. Defining thresholds means that drops can occur, even if your pool
allocation or overall license aren't exceeded.

Threshold enforcement takes effect after consumption if the relevant pool exceeds
the defined threshold value. This means that if low priority data exceeds the low
priority threshold, Observability Platform starts dropping data. The exact point
at which enforcement occurs beyond that value can vary. The smaller the threshold is
relative to overall capacity, the greater the chance for delay when enforcement takes
effect.

## View and manage pools

View [existing metric pools](/control/shaping/quotas/quotas-ui) in Observability
Platform on the Metrics Quotas page. If you haven't configured any metric pools,
Observability Platform shows a single **Default Pool**.

You can also use the [Metrics Live Telemetry Analyzer](/investigate/analyze/telemetry-analyzer)
to view the metrics that each pool contains, and filter by priority.

You can then [manage pools](/control/shaping/quotas/manage-pools) to shape and plan
your pool sizes, and plan for future usage.
