In addition to using Chronosphere Observability Platform, you can use the
[CreateEvent API](/tooling/api-info/data_definition/operations/CreateEvent)
to create change events. This API can ingest 300 change events per minute, per block
in a single tenant. The total request size must be less than 1&nbsp;MB.

## Change event fields

The CreateEvent API accepts the following fields with the stated limits:
