title: Authenticate with Observability Platform as a user
---
{/* -- dri: Garrett Guillotte -- */}


To access Chronosphere Observability Platform, a user must first use their user
account to authenticate. User accounts can authenticate interactively by signing in,
or non-interactively by using a personal access token.

For details about how to create and manage user accounts as an administrator, see
[User accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts). To authenticate a service
with Observability Platform, see [Service accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts).

## Sign in interactively

Observability Platform administrators can configure their organization to use a
single sign-on (SSO) provider for authentication, or to use an email address and
password, or to offer both methods to users.

{/* vale Chronosphere.WordList = NO */}

Regardless of the method, use one of these supported web browsers to access your
organization's login page for Observability Platform:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Brave

For example, if the domain name of your organization's Observability Platform tenant
is `example.chronosphere.io`, go to `https://example.chronosphere.io/login`.

{/* vale Chronosphere.WordList = YES */}

### Use single sign-on

Observability Platform supports several SSO providers, including:

- Okta
- Duo
- Azure Active Directory
- Google Suite

As an administrator, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) to enable a service on
your account, or if you need to add another provider.

To sign in if your organization has enabled SSO:

1. Click **Log in with Single Sign On** on the login page. This redirects you to
   your SSO provider.
1. Authenticate with your SSO provider. If successful, this redirects you back to
   Observability Platform.

If an SSO user can't sign in, email
[support@chronosphere.io](mailto:support@chronosphere.io) or contact Chronosphere
Support.

### Use an email and password

When an administrator in your organization requests a user account for you,
Observability Platform sends an invitation email containing instructions and a link
to create your account to the address they provided.

For details about how to create and manage user accounts as an administrator, see
[User accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts).

To create your user account after you receive your invitation email:

1. Click the invitation link you received from your account administrator. This
   opens the **Signup** page.
1. Enter your account details, including a password.
1. Click **Sign Up**. This sends a verification email to your address.
1. Open the verification email when it arrives.
1. Click the link inside the email.
1. After verification, sign in to your account from the login URL.

If your organization hasn't enabled SSO authentication, you must enter your email
address and password at the login page to access your user account.

After you sign in, Observability Platform redirects you to your organization's home
page.

### Reset your password

<Info>
If you have any problems signing in, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support).
</Info>

If you forget your password, you can reset it from the login page.

1. Click the **FORGOT PASSWORD?** link on the login page.
1. Enter your email address.
1. Click **Reset Password**. This sends the password reset email, which can take a
   few minutes to deliver. If you don't receive the email after a few minutes,
   examine your email client's spam filter.
1. Follow the instructions in the email to reset your password.

To confirm if a user has an account, have a user who can sign in to Observability
Platform. In the navigation menu, click
**<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin** and then select
**<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Users**
to ensure an account exists for the user's email address. If there's no account, have
an administrator invite the user. For details, see
[User accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts).

## Authenticate with a personal access token

To access Observability Platform with your user account while using non-interactive
tools, such as [Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) and
[Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform),
or to access [Chronosphere APIs](/tooling/api-info) or
[Prometheus API](/tooling/prometheus-api),
you can use a personal access token. For details, see
[Personal access tokens](/administer/accounts-teams/personal-access-tokens).
