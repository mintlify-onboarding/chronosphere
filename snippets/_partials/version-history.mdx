
Click **Version history** to display a panel with two tabs:

{/* vale Chronosphere.Spelling = NO */}

- [**Code config**](/tooling/gitops): Displays a code representation of the selected
  entity as of the time of the selected revision.
- **Code diff**: Displays a Git-style diff of the most-recent change made to the
  entity, in Chronosphere API format. To compare the selected revision to another
  revision in the history, click the **Compare With** dropdown and select the
  timestamp of the revision that you want to compare.
  - Click **Unified** to see the diff stacked horizontally.
  - Click **Split** to see changes side by side.

{/* vale Chronosphere.Spelling = YES */}

You can see both who made and the method used for the last change at the top
of the list of changes.

To view a revision in the history, click any entry in the list of timestamped
revisions. The timestamps default to your local timezone.

You can view unchanged lines within the diff by clicking the **Expand X lines**
links.

<Note>
The Version History view retains up to 500 revisions, or up to 15 months of revisions
if there are fewer than 500 revisions.
