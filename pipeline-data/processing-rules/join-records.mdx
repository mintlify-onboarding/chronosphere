The join records [processing rule](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) combines values
from multiple records into an array of values within a single record.

<Note>
To determine which values to combine, this rule checks the timestamp of each record,
then combines values from records that occur within the same nanosecond. This timestamp
is a piece of metadata that Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline assigns to all records that
pass through a pipeline, and is unrelated to any keys within the record itself.

| Name                                                                   | Key | Description | Default |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Source key**                                                         | `key` | Required. The key that contains values to join in an array. The resulting array will be assigned to a key with the same name. | _none_ |
| **Skip records where the specified key is missing** checkbox           | `skipMissing` | Indicates whether to modify the record if the key isn't found. | Not selected |
| **Comment**                                                            | `comment` | A custom note or description of the rule's function. This text is displayed next to the rule's name in the **Actions** list in the processing rules interface. | _none_ |

## Example

Using the join records processing rule lets you restructure your telemetry data
by turning multiple standalone events into a combined array. For example, given
these sample logs:

```json showLineNumbers
{"log":{"user_id":3,"action":"purchase"}}
{"log":{"user_id":4,"action":"click"}}
{"log":{"user_id":1,"action":"view"}}
{"log":{"user_id":5,"action":"click"}}
{"log":{"user_id":2,"action":"click"}}
```

A processing rule with the **Source key** value `log` returns the following result:

```json
{"log":[{"user_id":3,"action":"purchase"},{"user_id":4,"action":"click"},{"user_id":1,"action":"view"}]}
{"log":[{"user_id":5,"action":"click"},{"user_id":2,"action":"click"}]}
```

This rule combined the `log` key from multiple standalone records into a series
of unified `log` arrays. Because the first three events occurred within the same
nanosecond, their `log` values were combined within one array, and because the
fourth and fifth events occurred one nanosecond later, their `log` values were
combined within another array.
