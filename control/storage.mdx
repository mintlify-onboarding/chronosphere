Chronosphere uses [collectors](/ingest) to ingest data, and utilizes push and pull
models of ingestion, depending on the data collected and the method of ingestion.

Chronosphere provides the following control concepts to help manage your data you
keep only the data that's most important to your organization.

## Metric control concepts

Metrics use _quotas_ to assign specific percentages of your total persisted writes
limit to _pools_ of metrics. Each pool might represent teams or other logical
groupings within your organization. Use metric quotas to give each pool a specific
quota of your total persisted writes license, expressed either as a percentage or a
value in data points per second (DPPS).

To learn more about these control mechanisms, see
[quotas and pools](/control/shaping/quotas).

## Log control concepts

Logs use _partitions_, which are slices of your log data with distinct owners.
Partitions provide a consistent structure for attributing usage and costs to the
appropriate owners in your organization so they can isolate and control independent
their parts of the business.

Partitions let you apply _budgets_, which are optional shaping policies you can
assign to a partition to safeguard against runaway usage and overspending. Budgets
provide guardrails to combat runaway usage and overspending, and provide the
flexibility to enforce accountability at the right level of ownership. Budgets
include _thresholds_ that define which actions to take when a threshold is exceeded.

To learn more about these control mechanisms, see
[control log data](/control/consumption).

## Trace control concepts

Traces use _datasets_ as a control mechanism to organize your data and map it to
named groups relevant to your organization. Datasets can either overlap or stand
alone, and can be assigned to only a single business unit or service within
your organization.

Each dataset entity lets you define a filter to assign specific chunks of data to a
particular dataset. A default, system-defined dataset exists for budgeting. You can
assign the default dataset to data that isn't explicitly assigned to any other
dataset.

To change the sampling rates of one or more datasets and to more effectively control
your persisted data, use _behaviors_. This shaping mechanism lets you change sampling
rates of one or more datasets without needing to write fine-grained sampling or
shaping rules.

To learn more about these control mechanisms, see
[sample your traces](/control/sampling/).

## Downsampling

[Collectors](/ingest/) ingest metrics at specific intervals, based on system
configuration. This granularity of metric data can be helpful in diagnostic efforts,
but particular issues might not be served by such granularity. If you are able to
diagnose production issues using a coarser granularity of metric data, _downsampling_
the data reduces the amount of data persisted to the Observability Platform database.

Downsample incoming data in Observability Platform using these methods:

- Change the Chronosphere Collector configuration by
  [changing the rate](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/discover/scrape-configuration#global-scrape-configuration)
  the Collector publishes metrics to the server.
- Use [mapping rules](/control/shaping/rules/mapping) to downsample metrics
  that aren't aggregated.
- Use [rollup rules](/control/shaping/rules/rollup) to downsample aggregated
  metrics.

Over time, persisted data uses significant storage capacity. Observability Platform
performs [long-term downsampling](/control/shaping/downsampling) to control data
storage costs while retaining important statistics.

Be aware that [late arriving data](/administer/limits-licensing/limits/metric-limits#late-arriving-metrics)
can affect downsampling.
