title: Verify the Collector is scraping metrics
---
{/* -- dri: Garrett Guillotte -- */}


Use the following methods to ensure the Collector is scraping the intended metrics.

<Info>
Contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) if there are other Collector statistics you
want to access. Similarly, contact Chronosphere Support to request having specific
telemetry data removed from Chronosphere Observability Platform.

## Live Telemetry Analyzer

[Live Telemetry Analyzer](/investigate/analyze/telemetry-analyzer) lets you inspect, in real
time, the stream of metrics that Observability Platform is ingesting. You can use the
Metrics Profiler to verify the Collector's connection to Observability Platform by
viewing the metrics that the Collector emits about itself.

1. In the navigation menu, click **<Icon icon="shield" /> Go to Admin**
   and then select
   **<Icon icon="microscope" /> Analyzers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Live Telemetry**.
1. Click the **Metrics** tab.
1. Click **Capture live data** to display streaming metrics.
1. In the **Keys** list, click the **`__name__`** and **instance** label keys.
1. In the **Values** filter, enter the following key:value pairs:

    ```text
    __name__:chronocollector_*

    instance:INSTANCE_NAME
    ```

    Replace _`INSTANCE_NAME`_ with the host and port where the Collector is running.
    For example, a Collector running locally uses an instance name of
    `localhost:3030`.

    In the **Values** list, the displayed metrics include your Collector instance in
    the **instance** column.

## Metrics Explorer

[Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer) lets you validate metrics if
you know the name of the metric or label you're searching for.

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Metrics Explorer**.

1. Enter the following query in the query field.

   ```text
   count(chronocollector_jobs) by (instance)
   ```

1. Click **<Icon icon="arrows-rotate" />Run**.

The name of your Collector instance returned from the `kubectl logs` command
displays in the table of metrics:

| Time                | Instance                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 2023-02-03 10:56:04 | default/chronocollector-POD\_NAME |

_`POD_NAME`_ is the name of the Kubernetes pod where your Collector instance is
running.

### Dashboards

Observability Platform includes a **Collectors** dashboard by default that's
actively maintained and updated. This [dashboard](/observe/dashboards) displays
information about the metrics the Collector scrapes. When the Collector begins
receiving metrics, the Collector dashboard panels populate and display statistics
such as:

- Number of Collectors running on the cluster
- Number of metrics scraped per second
- Number of scrape targets per job
- Memory and CPU consumption
- Push latency to Chronosphere

Creating monitors based on some of these key metrics can help you detect if a
Collector is performing poorly.

Refer to the
[default dashboard metrics](/overview/concepts/dictionary#collectors)
for the full list of available metrics.

In the navigation menu select **<Icon icon="dashboard" /> Dashboards**
to access the Collector dashboard.

- If you're using Kubernetes discovery, the Collector configuration includes an
  annotation for the Collector dashboard by default.
- If you're using Prometheus discovery and don't see the Collector dashboard, ensure
  the following structure exists in your Collector configuration file under the
  `discovery` section:

  ```yaml
  discovery:
    prometheus:
      - job_name: 'Collector'
        scrape_interval: 15s
        scrape_timeout: 30s
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['0.0.0.0:3030']
  ```
