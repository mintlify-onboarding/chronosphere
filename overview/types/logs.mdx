Logs Explorer helps you search log data so your teams have more detailed context to
help identify and fix the root cause of issues. Use the following documentation to
learn about Chronosphere Observability Platform logging and Logs Explorer.

## Ingest

Ingest data from any of the supported sources. After ingesting log data,
[verify](/ingest/logs/verify-logs) that Observability Platform is receiving your logs
as anticipated.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="paper-plane"
    title="Ingest data"
    titleBackgroundColor="#705DA0"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/ingest/logs"
  />
</Columns>

## Control

Create _partitions_ and _budgets_, which are grouping and budgeting mechanisms that
let you structure log usage by ownership and purpose that matter to your
organization. You can then use [shaping tools](/control/consumption/shape-logs) in
Observability Platform to transform, reshape, retain, or exclude data.

  <Card icon="shapes"

    titleBackgroundColor="#705DA0"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/control/consumption"
  />
</Columns>

## Query

Learn how to construct queries in Logs Explorer to focus your search and find
important log data. Use the supported functions and
[query language](/investigate/querying/query-logs/query-syntax) to find the log data
you need.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="magnifying-glass-plus"
    title="Query data"
    titleBackgroundColor="#705DA0"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/investigate/querying/query-logs"
  />
</Columns>

## Observe

Create standard dashboards query and
[visualize log data](/investigate/querying/dashboard-query) queries. You can also
create [alerts](/investigate/alerts/monitors) to watch time series data that's
specified in a monitor query, and receive notifications when the query matches
specified logs.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="display"
    title="Observe data"
    titleBackgroundColor="#705DA0"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/observe/dashboards"
  />
</Columns>

## Connect

Create links to log data from other parts of Observability Platform, such as linking
to logs from traces and linking to logs from dashboards.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="link"
    title="Create links"
    titleBackgroundColor="#705DA0"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/investigate/querying/create-links"
  />
</Columns>

## Analyze

Analyze the volume of log data passing through Observability Platform, view the
utility of data patterns and where they're used, and identify opportunities for
reducing, augmenting, or routing log data to lower costs.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card icon="chart-bar"
    title="Analyze data"
    titleBackgroundColor="#705DA0"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/investigate/analyze/logs-usage"
  />
</Columns>
