Chronosphere Observability Platform supports creating dashboards from queries for
certain telemetry data types. You can add queries to a new dashboard or an existing
dashboard to visualize the query results.

Complete the following steps to create a [dashboard](/observe/dashboards) with a
query:

1. In the navigation menu select one of the Explorers that support adding queries to
   a dashboard:

   - **Logs**: **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Logs
     Explorer**.
   - **Metrics**: **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Metrics
     Explorer**.

1. Construct a query that returns the data you want to view:

   - **Logs**: Construct a query for [log data](/investigate/querying/query-logs).
   - **Metrics**: Construct a query for [metric data](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer#enter-and-run-a-query).
     Use the [Query Builder](/investigate/querying/metrics/builder) to help build and
     optimize your query.

1. In the main navigation bar, click **<AddToDashboardIcon /> Add to Dashboard**.
1. In the **Add to dashboard** dialog, enter a name for your query. The query you
   defined is entered in the **Name** field by default.
1. Click **Select dashboard** to add the panel to an existing dashboard, or click
   **create a new dashboard** to create a new dashboard containing the panel.

   Observability Platform previews the addition of the panel to the dashboard.
   - For an existing dashboard, click the **Panel group** dropdown to add the panel
     to an existing panel group, or select **New Panel Group** from the dropdown to
     add it to a new group.
   - For a new dashboard, click the **Dashboard name** field to name the dashboard,
     and click the **Owner** dropdown to choose which Collection owns the dashboard.
1. Click **Add to dashboard** to add the panel to your dashboard.

Observability Platform creates the dashboard with the query you defined or adds the
query to the specified dashboard. You can
[change the panel's type](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-type) if you
want the query to display as a different visualization.
