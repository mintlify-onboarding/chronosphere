Alerting is critical to problem response. Reliable, available, actionable information
lets observability teams act on problems quickly. Alert criticality and other
metadata can help determine the severity of an issue, but the graph in a given alert
is the first place users look to create a representation of their data and the state
of their metrics.

Chronosphere Observability Platform supports unfurling of monitor graphs in
[Slack](https://slack.com/), enabling Slack users to view or share monitors in Slack
channels aimed at mitigating alerts.


<Info>
Unfurling isn't supported for Metrics Explorer and Dashboard links.
</Info>

If your Slack alerting management uses a Slack app with granular permissions, such as
the [PagerDuty app](https://writethedocs.slack.com/apps/A1FKYAUUX-pagerduty?tab=more_info),
and that app pastes the alerting Observability Platform monitor link in the Slack
message, those links unfurl.

If you use a legacy app, such as the [incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks?_gl=1*5z9zlo*_gcl_au*NDgyNTg2ODE5LjE2OTMyNDI1NDM)
app, those links won't unfurl. The Observability Platform's
[Slack notifier](/investigate/alerts/notifications/notifiers/slack) uses an incoming webhook
and doesn't support unfurling.

If a user posts a monitor link, it always unfurls.

## Adding Observability Platform to Slack

Chronosphere recommends completing this procedure as a user who is part of a team
with the
[SysAdmin role](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts#grant-system-administrator-sysadmin-privileges-to-users).
The Slack integration uses the same Observability Platform permissions as the user
who installed the app. Users with lower permissions levels might not unfurl all
graphs.

You can create a [Slack notifier](/investigate/alerts/notifications/notifiers/slack)
in Observability Platform.

To integrate Slack with Observability Platform:

1. Go to `https://MY_COMPANY.chronosphere.io/auth/slack/redirect`
   to install the Slack app for Chronosphere.

   _`MY_COMPANY`_ is your company or organization name.

1. If you have multiple workspaces, select the workspace you're interested in from
   the menu.
1. If you have multiple Observability Platform tenants you want to have expanded graphs
   in, go to `https://MY_COMPANY.chronosphere.io/auth/slack/redirect` to associate
   your Slack user with a user in that tenant.
1. Follow the prompts to authorize the integration.
1. Add the Slack app to the specific channel you wan to send alerts to.

   <Info>
The Slack app is channel-specific, and must be added to each channel in a
   workspace that needs unfurled graphs.
</Info>

A confirmation page displays when integration successfully completes.

After integration, pasting a Observability Platform graph URL into Slack displays
a thumbnail of the graph as a threaded message.

Chart images expire after seven days.

## Remove the Observability Platform integration from Slack
