<EarlyAccess/>

When [viewing all monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors#view-available-monitors),
you can select an individual monitor to view its details and take actions for that
monitor. Chronosphere Observability Platform populates these monitor pages with
information necessary to understand, investigate, and control a monitor's alerts.

Monitor pages include:

- Controls to [create the monitor](/investigate/alerts/monitors/monitor-actions-new#create-a-monitor)
  or duplicate it to create new monitors
- A time series chart visualizing the monitor's queries and any alerts triggered
  over the visualized time span
- Details of the monitor's configuration and purpose
- A summary of Observability Platform's [alert analysis](/investigate/alerts/monitors/analyze-alerts)
- Tools to
  [filter query results](/investigate/alerts/monitors/monitor-actions-new#filter-query-results)
  by time series, change events, and [signals](/investigate/alerts/notifications/signals)
- The monitor's [alert history](/investigate/alerts/monitors/monitor-actions-new#view-alert-history),
  which describes when alerts triggered and which notifications were sent
- [A history of changes](/investigate/alerts/monitors/monitor-actions-new#view-version-history)
  made to the monitor
- A shortcut to create or modify a [muting rule](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules)
  tailored to the monitor's parameters

## Design a monitor

Most monitors trigger alerts when a value matches a specific condition, such as
when an error condition defined by its query exceeds a threshold. For example, an
error condition lasting longer than a monitor's designated one-minute threshold can
trigger an alert.

You can also trigger alerts when a value doesn't exist. For example, you can trigger
an alert when a host stops sending metrics, which might indicate that the host is
unavailable. This condition triggers only if the entire monitor query doesn't return
any results.

## Review a monitor's details

A monitor's page prioritizes its current **Status** with indicators of how many
alerts of any severity are actively triggered, and whether the alert's notifications
are being muted. A **Passing** status indicates that nothing tracked by the
monitor is actively triggering an alert.

If some of a monitor's alerts are muted, Observability Platform reports this in
a banner that you can expand to view **More details**, including links to any muting rules
silencing any of a monitor's notifications.

You can also review the monitor's **Signal labels** alongside its status to better
understand which labels include results being tracked by the monitor.

A monitor's page also includes a sidebar that lists:

- **Monitor information**, including the collection assigned as its **Owner**, the
  **Team** responsible for it, and its notification **Policy**
- The monitor's **Datasource** and update **Interval**
- **Additional information**, which can include relevant **Labels**, and also a
  **Description** and custom **Links** to additional information and context for
  responders as defined in the monitor's **Annotations**
- A summary of the monitor's **[Alert analysis](/investigate/alerts/monitors/analyze-alerts)**,
  which includes a breakdown of how many alerts are being triggered in each severity
  level or are muted
- An **Analyze** link, where you can [analyze groups of alert patterns](/investigate/alerts/monitors/analyze-alerts#analyze-alert-patterns) over time

## Create a monitor

Before creating a monitor, first complete the following prerequisite tasks:

1. Create a [notifier](/investigate/alerts/notifications/notifiers) to define where
   to deliver alerts and who to notify.
1. Create a [notification policy](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies) to
   determine how to route notifications to notifiers based on signals that trigger
   from your monitor. You can select the notifier you created for the notification policy's
   critical or warning statuses.

You can then create a new monitor in
[Observability Platform](#create-a-monitor-in-observability-platform), or using
code representations with the
[Terraform provider or Chronoctl](/investigate/alerts/monitors#create-a-monitor).

When editing a monitor, use the same interface as when you created it.
If you used Terraform to create the monitor, Observability Platform indicates when
you must also use Terraform to modify it.

### Create a monitor in Observability Platform

To add a new monitor:

1. In the navigation menu select one of these locations:
   - **<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerts <span aria-label="and then">></span> Monitors**.
   - **<Icon icon="wrench" /> Platform <span aria-label="and then">></span> Collections**,
     and then select the collection you want to create a monitor for. This can be a
     standard collection or a [service](/observe/services).
1. Create the monitor:
   - From the **Monitors** page, click **Create monitor** to open the **Add Monitor**
     panel.
   - To create a monitor by duplicating an existing monitor, click the monitor on
     the **Monitors** page, then click **<Icon icon="copy" /> Duplicate**
     to open the **Duplicate monitor** panel.
   - From the **Collections** page, in the **Monitors** panel, click **Manage**,
     then click **New monitor**.

After you've started to create a new monitor, continue by
[editing it](#edit-a-monitor-in-observability-platform).

### Edit a monitor in Observability Platform

To edit a new or existing monitor:

1. Select a monitor from the list of monitors, and then click **Edit** on the selected monitor page.
1. Enter the information for the monitor based on its [data model](/investigate/alerts/monitors/data-model).
1. Select an **Owner** to organize and filter your monitor. You can select a
   collection or a service.
1. Enter a **Monitor Name**, which you can change after creating the monitor. Monitor
   names are static strings and don't accept label variables, such as `$labels.LABEL_NAME`.
1. Choose a **Notification Policy** to determine which notification policy to use
   at a particular alert severity.
1. Enter **Labels** as key/value pairs to categorize and filter monitors.
1. In the **Query** section, choose the type of query you want to enter:

   - **Prometheus**: Enter a valid Prometheus query. Click **Edit in Query Builder**
     to open your query in the [Query Builder](/investigate/querying/metrics/builder), where
     you can construct, optimize, and debug your query before saving it. After
     modifying your query, click **Done** to return to the **Add Monitor** page.
   - **Graphite**: Enter a valid Graphite query.
   - **Logs**: Enter a valid log query, which must include the
     [`make-series`](/investigate/querying/query-logs/query-syntax#make-series)
     operator with a specified `step` size to return data. This operator uses the
     [`count()`](/investigate/querying/query-logs/query-syntax#count) function by
     default, but you can specify different operators instead.

     For example, the following query creates a time chart that includes the average for
     `latencyInSeconds`. The `step` parameter defines the time step for each bucket in
     [Prometheus time duration format](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-durations):

     ```sql
     severity = "WARNING"
     | make-series avg(latencyInSeconds) step 15m by severity, service
     ```

      <Note>
      If the log query includes a field that contains a period in its name and you
          want to use signals to group notifications, use an
          [alias for that field name](/investigate/querying/query-logs/query-syntax#alias-field-names).
          Otherwise, periods are converted to underscores in the generated visualization.
      </Note>
1. Use these options to validate and update your query:

   - Click **Check Query** to validate your query and preview query results. In the
     query preview, use the following options to understand your query:

     - Toggle **Show thresholds** to display the monitor's defined thresholds.
     - Select a time range up to the present in the
       **<Icon icon="clock" /> [time range selector](/navigate/time-ranges)**.

       If your selected time period has too many alerts, or the entire graph appears
       to display in alerted status, reduce the selected time period. If multiple
       alerts would have fired simultaneously, only one threshold marker displays.
       The banner shows the correct number of alerts. For example, if a critical and
       a warning would fire at the same time, only one alert displays on the graph.
       The banner shows two alerts would have fired.

   - Click **Open in Explorer** to open your query in
     [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer), where you can review
     your query for syntax errors and make necessary changes.

1. For Prometheus queries, test monitor conditions by reviewing when a monitor would
   have triggered, based on historical data. The preview reflects existing monitor
   schedules, signal grouping, and overrides:

   - Use the **Show alert durations** toggle to display the time period over which
   the alert would have been active.
   - Toggle **Simulate alerts** to backtest your condition against existing data. You
     must define at least one condition for alert simulations to work.

      <Note>
      Alert simulations use existing data, and can't predict future alerts.
      </Note>

     If your selected query returns too much data, the graph displays an error.
     Chronosphere recommends selecting shorter time periods for testing, when possible.
     Alert simulation isn't available outside the
     [raw data retention period](/administer/limits-licensing/licensing#ingestion-limits-and-retention-policies).

1. Optional: Group alerts based on the results returned from the query by choosing an
   option in the **Signals** section.
   [Signals](/investigate/alerts/notifications/signals) use a unique set of labels to
   create groups of notifications when a monitor alert triggers or resolves.

    <Note>
    If you select **per signal (multiple alerts)** to generate multiple alerts, enter
      a label key that differs in name and casing from the label you enter in the
      **Key** field in the **Labels** section. For example, if you enter `environment`
      in the **Key** field, you might use `Environments` as the **Label Key** to match
      on. [Pinned scopes](/navigate/pinned-scopes) can be used as a **Label Key**.
    </Note>

1. Define a condition and sustain period (duration of time) in the **Conditions**
   section, and assign the resulting alert a severity (warning or critical). In
   the **Sustain** field, enter a value followed by an abbreviated unit such as
   `60s`. Valid units are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), or `d`
   (days). The dialog also displays the notifiers associated with the monitor for
   reference.

    <Note>
    To alert on missing or no data, select **not exists** in the **Alert when value**
      dropdown.
    </Note>

1. In the **Resolve** field, enter a time period for the resolve window as a
   value followed by an abbreviated unit such as `30s`. Valid units are `s`
   (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), or `d` (days).
1. Add notes for the monitor in the **Annotations** section, such as runbooks,
   links to related dashboards, data links to related traces, and documentation
   links.
1. Click **Save**.

## Mute a monitor

If a monitor has any active [muting rules](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules),
Observability Platform reports the number of active muting rules and when they
expire in a banner. The banner displays even if there aren't active alerts. The
monitor's **Status** also reports as **Muted** if all alerts are muted, and its
**Alert analysis** summary breaks down the muting or severity for all of the monitor's
alerts.

To mute the selected monitor, a signal from a monitor, or any stored time series,
click **<Icon icon="bell-slash" /> Mute monitor** to add a muting rule.
If a muting rule already exists, the button is named **Add muting rule**.

When you create a muting rule from a monitor, Observability Platform prepopulates
the muting rule's **Name** field with the monitor's name.

For more information about creating and editing muting rules, see
[Muting rules](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules).

## View additional actions

The monitor page header includes controls for additional monitor actions. The following
actions might be visible depending on the resolution of your display or width of
your browser window. Some of these actions are always organized in a
<Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical docs menu.

If any of the following actions aren't visible on your device, click the
<Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical docs icon in the page header to
access them.

### Add a comment

To comment on a monitor:

1. On the monitor's page, click **+ Add comment**.
1. Follow the instructions to [add a comment](/navigate/comments).

### Explore the query

To examine and modify the query and metrics that the monitor uses, click
**Open in Explorer** to open the query in the [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer).

### Create a custom event

You can create a custom change event and associate it with a monitor directly from
the monitor's page:

1. On the monitor's page, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />three vertical dots icon
   in the page's header, then click **Create event**.
1. Follow the instructions to
   [create a change event](/observe/enable-events/use-events#create-change-events).

### View version history

**Version history** opens the history of changes for the monitor. To view the
history of changes for a selected monitor, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />
three vertical dots icon.

<VersionHistory />

### Connect monitors to services or collections

Services and collections can
[own monitors](/observe/services/service-pages#own-dashboards-and-monitors), but you
can also connect a monitor to any service or collection.

**Manage Connections** opens a panel where you can manage connections between the
selected monitor and any service or collection.

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerts <span aria-label="and then">></span> Monitors**.
1. Click the name of the monitor you want to edit.
1. To the right of the monitor's name, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />
   three vertical dots icon and select **Manage connections**.
1. Add or remove [a connection](/observe/services/service-pages#connected-resources).

### View alert history

A monitor's **Alert history** lists each of the monitor's alerts, the time and date
when it was triggered, the type of alert, and details like its signals and notifiers.

To display the monitor's alert history:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="bell" /> Alerts <span aria-label="and then">></span> Monitors**.
1. Click the name of the monitor you want to edit.
1. To the right of the monitor's name, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />
   three vertical dots icon and select **Alert history**.

To filter the alert history by event type:

1. Click the **Event types** dropdown.
1. Select the event types in the list that you want to view. To filter the list,
   click the **Search** field and begin typing.

To sort the alert history table by the contents of a column, click the column's
header.

To view a representation of an alert in the history as JSON, click the **\>** icon
on the alert's row. To copy the representation, click the **<Icon icon="copy" />**
icon in the code representation.

## Filter query results

When viewing a monitor, you can filter the results plotted on the graph.

- Define which alerts to display on the chart by clicking either **All**, **Alerting**,
  or **Critical**.
- Use the **<Icon icon="clock" /> [time range selector](/navigate/time-ranges)**
  to define the time range of query results visualized in the chart.
- Click **Show thresholds** to draw horizontal threshold lines on the chart for
  the monitor's triggering conditions.
- In the series legend, click the color of one or more series to filter them from
  the time series chart.
- In the series legend, click the **<Icon icon="magnifying-glass-plus" /> Add** or
  **<Icon icon="magnifying-glass-minus" /> Remove label from filters** icons that
  appear only when hovering over a label column in one of the legend's rows.

  These filters match only if the time series includes _all_ filtered labels.
- If alerting is enabled, click **Group by signal** to group the series legend
  by signal labels.

To display the query used by the monitor, click the **Show query** toggle.

## Filter change events

Use the **Display events** panel to select which types of change events to depict
on the monitor's **Query results** chart. Change events use
[category icons](/observe/enable-events/use-events#categorize-change-events-intentionally)
for ease of visibility into different event types.

To toggle change events and categories:

1. Click **<Icon icon="layer-group" /> Events** to open the **Display events** panel.
1. In the **Status** section, toggle **Chart events enabled** to show or hide all
   change events.
1. In the **Categories** section, select the change event categories to visualize
   in the chart.
1. Click **Save** to save your changes.

For more information about change event details, see
[Change event details](/observe/enable-events/use-events#change-event-details).
