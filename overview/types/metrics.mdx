A _time series_ is a set of data points with matching labels. A _metric_ is a time
series with a common name, such as the `__name__` label. Use the following
documentation to learn about interacting with metric data in Chronosphere
Observability Platform.

<Note>
See the [metrics dictionary](/overview/concepts/dictionary) to learn about the
metrics created by and specific to Observability Platform.
</Note>

## Ingest

Observability Platform natively supports
[Prometheus, StatsD, DogStatsD, and other metrics formats](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/addl-metrics)
with the Chronosphere Collector, and
[OpenTelemetry](/ingest/metrics-traces/otel) metrics using the
OpenTelemetry Collector.

</Columns>

## Query

Learn how to construct queries in Metrics Explorer to investigate query requests,
responses, and statistics. Use a query to select and filter the metrics you’re
interested in, and then apply functions to them. You can also learn about writing
[PromQL queries](/investigate/querying/promql) and applying functions to perform
calculations within queries.

    href="/investigate/querying/metrics"
  />
</Columns>

## Observe

Create standard dashboards to query and
[visualize log data](/investigate/querying/dashboard-query) queries. You can also
create [alerts](/investigate/alerts/monitors) to watch time series data that's
specified in a monitor query, and receive notifications when the query matches
specified logs.

  <Card horizontal icon="display"
    title="Observe data"
    titleBackgroundColor="#28a561"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/observe/dashboards"
  />
</Columns>

## Analyze

Analyze both your metric data and queries to gain insights, understand the value of
your data semantics, and highlight changes and their impacts.

 <Columns cols={1}>
  <Card horizontal icon="chart-bar"
    title="Analyze data"
    titleBackgroundColor="#28a561"
    titleTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    href="/investigate/analyze"
  />
</Columns>

## Control

Use the Chronosphere Control Plane to reduce the amount of metric data retained in
your system over time. Identify and evaluate data, and then reshape the overall
dataset to eliminate waste, unnecessary noise, and cost.

 <Columns cols={1}>
  <Card horizontal icon="shapes"
