{/* -- dri: Adam Locke -- */}


Viewing all events in your environment while trying to remediate an issue can be
overwhelming. Use Changes Explorer to focus on specific _change events_ that matter
when you're trying to understand the root cause of an issue. Each change event
describes a change within your environment or Chronosphere Observability Platform
tenant at a specific time.

You can filter change events by different attributes to locate where and when an
issue occurred so that you can understand what changed leading up to an issue. Having
this context helps determine the actions required to minimize the mean time to
recovery.

## Modify filters

Changes Explorer lets you filter change events to narrow the focus of your search.
Begin by selecting a broader attribute, such as specifying a time window, and then
use the [filtering syntax](#filtering-syntax) to incorporate additional filtering
attributes. If you know specifics about the change event you're looking for, enter a
regular expression matching the title of the change event or a specific label.

### Basic filtering

Use this method of selecting individual attributes to filter change events from a
broad scope to a narrow focus. The following steps are recommended methods of
filtering. You can choose to start with a different attribute based on what change
event you're searching for.

To use basic filtering:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Changes Explorer**.

1. On the Changes Explorer page, select a time window to display change events for.
   The default time window is the last hour.

1. Define your filter. You can use the sidebar, filter box, or a combination of both
   to specify your filter criteria:

   - **Sidebar**: Expand the section relating to the attribute you want to filter on.
     Hold the pointer over the attribute, and then click the operator next to the
     attribute name to include or exclude that attribute as part of your filter.

     For example, click the equals operator next to the **Alerts** category:

     ```text
     category = "alerts"
     ```

   - **Filter box**: Use the [filtering syntax](#filtering-syntax) to enter the
     attribute you want to search for, such as the type of change event to display.
     For example, you might want to display only alerts because you're trying to
     locate an alert for a particular monitor.

     ```text
     category = "alerts"
     ```

      <Info>
      Change event categories are case sensitive, and must be all lowercase when
          entering values in the filter box. For example, `category = "alerts"` is valid,
          but entering `category = "Alerts"` returns no data.
      </Info>

     If you're unsure what attributes you can search for, click the filter box and
     press `Control+Space` to display all available attributes.

1. Click **Run**, or press `Shift+Enter` (`Shift+Return` on
   macOS) to submit your filter.

1. Expand your filter by adding a type of change event to display. If you entered
   `alerts` as the `category`, you might enter `monitor_triggered_notification_sent`
   as the type to display only alerts where the monitor triggered and sent a
   notification.

    ```text
    category = "alerts" AND type = "monitor_triggered_notification_sent"
    ```

    <Info>
    The operators `AND` plus `OR` are case insensitive, so you can use `AND`,
    `and`, `OR`, and `or` interchangeably.
    </Info>

1. As you refine your filter, click and select a portion of the time chart to zoom in
   to a smaller time window.

1. Add to your filter by entering the `title` of the change event you want to focus on.

   For example, you might to include results where the `title` begins with
   `slack-receiver` to narrow your scope.

   ```text
   category = "alerts" AND type = "monitor_triggered_notification_sent" AND title =~ "^slack-receiver.*"
   ```

   The results update to include only change events that contain the value you enter.

1. Click a change event in the results list to display its
   [full details](/observe/enable-events/use-events#change-event-details).

### Advanced filtering

If you know details about the change event you're searching for, use the
[filtering syntax](#filtering-syntax) to build your filter. For example, if you know
you're searching for an alert in your production environment, create a filter to
help you locate a related change event.

To use advanced filtering:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Changes Explorer**.

   The alert you received was for the `production_cluster`, but you're unsure which
   production environment you need to investigate.

1. In the filter box, define a filter to match any `alerts` from a triggered monitor
   that sent a notification, which also contains `production` in the `title`.

   ```text
   category = "alerts" AND type = "monitor_triggered_notification_sent" AND title =~ ".*production_cluster.*"
   ```

   This filter matches any change events that contains `production_cluster` in the
   `title`, such as `production_cluster=production-east` and
   `production_cluster=production-west`.

    <Info>
    Including a `type` in your filter is a shortcut for narrowing focus to a particular
      change event category. For example, `type="deploy_end"` displays only change events
      of the `deploy` type, because only that `category` includes this `type`.
    </Info>

1. Click **Run**, or press `Shift+Enter` (`Shift+Return` on
   macOS) to submit your filter.

1. As you refine your filter, click and select a portion of the time chart to zoom in
   to a shorter time window.

1. Click a change event in the results list to display its
   [full details](/observe/enable-events/use-events#change-event-details).

### Access recent and saved filters

When investigating issues, you might use the same change events filter frequently.
Rather than redefining the filter, use recent and saved filters to access previously
defined filters in Observability Platform. You can apply a fully defined filter from
a previous time period by clicking the filter from the list.

Recent filters are available globally to all users in Observability Platform and
persist for 14 days.

To access recent and saved filters:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Changes Explorer**.
1. Click **<Icon icon="font" /> View filters** to display all available filters.
1. Click the **Recent** tab or the **Saved** tab to display the filters you want to
   view.
1. Locate the filter you want to apply and click it.

The parameters in the filter override any parameters in the filter box.

### Save a filter

You can save change event filters that you access frequently so they're always
available in Observability Platform. Saved filters are like bookmarks you can
reference when you need them.

To save a filter:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Changes Explorer**.
1. In the filter box, define your filter. The **Save filter** button is unavailable
   until you run your filter.
1. Click **Run** to run your filter.
1. Click **Save filter** to save your filter.
1. In the **Filters** window, enter a name for your filter and click **Save**.

Your filter displays in the **Saved** tab of the **Filters** window. You can
[access your saved filters](#access-recent-and-saved-filters) and apply them at any
time.

Users with [SysAdmin](/administer/accounts-teams#grant-system-administrator-sysadmin-privileges-to-a-team)
privileges can share their saved filters with all users.

To share a quick filter:

1. Hold the pointer over the filter you want to share.
1. Click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots icon.
1. Click **Add to quick filters**.

To stop sharing a quick filter, hold the pointer over the filter and then click the
**<Icon icon="trash" /> trash can** icon. You can't delete the default
filters.

## Filtering syntax

Observability Platform provides a lightweight, flexible syntax for filtering change
events, both in Changes Explorer and when filtering change events in results for a
monitor. This syntax implements predefined keys that accept a comparison operator,
such as an equals sign `=`, and a value.

```text
KEY =|!=|=~|!~ VALUE AND|OR (KEY =|!=|=~|!~ VALUE)
```

For example, the following filter matches any `deploys` where the type is either
`build_finished` or `deploy_end`, and the title contains `production_cluster`:

```text
category = "deploys" AND (type = "build_finished" OR type = "deploy_end") AND title =~ ".*production_cluster.*"
```

<Info>
Change Event categories are case sensitive. Each of the categories that Chronosphere
[supports by default](/observe/enable-events/use-events#categorize-change-events-intentionally)
are lowercase and must be queried in all lowercase. For example,
`"category": "alerts"` is valid, but `"category": "Alerts"` is invalid.

Any custom categories must be queried using the case they were created in. For
example, if you created a category called `INGEST`, any queries in Changes Explorer
must use `INGEST` in all uppercase as the category to query.
</Info>

### Features

The filtering syntax for change events supports the following features:

- **Autocomplete**: Start typing a key to get autocomplete values. Press
  `Control+Space` to display suggestions.
- **Nested queries**: Use parentheses `()` to establish the order of operations for
  complex filters.
- **Label search**: Filter on labels by using a dot separator between the `labels`
  key and the value you want to match on.
- **String identification**: Use either single `''` or double `""` quotes to identify
  strings.

### Keys

The filtering syntax supports the following keys:

- `category`: Event category for organizing change events. This key supports the
  following values:
  - `alerts`: Changes in telemetry caught by Observability Platform monitors and the
    event life cycle they use to track them. This includes alert triggers, resolved
    alerts, and alert notifications.
  - `broadcasts`: Changes that track visibility for an outage, large marketing
    campaigns starting, or events that might cause an increase in usage such as the
    end of a sporting event or a big shopping day of the year.
  - `chronosphere`: Changes to the configuration of Observability Platform that can
    affect the behavior of persisted data, evaluated by monitors and presented in
    dashboards.
  - `deploys`: Changes that track the progress of new code deployed into an
    environment.
  - `feature_flags`: Changes to feature flags and other dynamic configuration
    controls that affect the way code executes in a program without requiring a
    deployment.
  - `infrastructure`: Changes to the underlying operating structures and fabric of
    an environment, such as networking, security, container orchestration, and data
    stores.
  - `lens_service`: Changes specific to an individual [service](/observe/services).
    Create a filter including `lens_service` and the name of the service you want to
    filter on, such as `lens_service = "auth"`.
  - `third_party`: Changes to the availability or status of dependencies outside of
    your organization, such as APIs your services rely on that other organizations
    provide and operate.
- `labels`: Label metadata you've annotated your change events with, such as `build`,
  `environment`, or `description`. To search for labels, use a dot separator between
  the `labels` key and the value you want to match on. For example, to match on the
  `build.branch` label for the `master` branch, enter `labels.build.branch = "master"`.
- `source`: Event source, such as `alert_history`, `buildkite`, or `deployer`. Each
  category has a unique subset of sources.
- `title`: Event title, either partial or complete. Use regular expressions to match
  on parts of a title.
- `type`: Event type, such as `build_started`, `deploy_start`, or `monitor_muted`.

### Operators

After entering an operator in the filter box, you can click the operator to display a
dropdown with additional supported operators. This feature lets you quickly change
operators in your existing filter. If you modify operators with this feature, you
must click **Run** to submit the modified filter.

The filtering syntax supports the following operators:

| Operator | Description          |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| =        | Equals               |
| !=       | Does not equals      |
| =\~      | Matches regex        |
| !\~      | Does not match regex |
| AND      | Additive operator    |
| OR       | Subjective operator  |

When using a regular expression, enter `.*` on either side of the expression you want
to match. For example, `".*production_cluster.*"` matches both
`"production_cluster=production-east"` and `"production_cluster=production-west"`.

Filters with the `AND` operator take precedence. If your filter doesn't use
parentheses, Observability Platform evaluates all `AND` statements sequentially,
followed by any `OR` statements and the next set of `AND` filters.

The operators `AND` plus `OR` are case insensitive, so you can use `AND`, `and`,
`OR`, and `or` interchangeably.

### Examples

This syntax supports nesting using parentheses so you can create complex queries. For
example, the following filter matches on two different types, or where the source is
not `deployer` and the `cluster` label starts with `production-cluster`.

```text
type =~ "build_started|build_running" OR (source != "deployer" AND labels.cluster =~ "^production-cluster.*")
```

The following filter matches on two different types where the `title` begins with
`usagestats`.

```text
type =~ "monitor_triggered|monitor_triggered_notification_failed_to_send" AND title =~ "^usagestats.*"
```

The following filter matches on `deploys` from the `deployer` source where the
`deployment_id` equals a particular value.

```text
category = "deploys" AND source = "deployer" AND labels.deployment_id = "36z9aaebqcc4oosuwr3v97qrgp"
```

You can filter specifically on
[services](/observe/services/service-pages#display-change-events) by including
`lens_service` and the name of the service you want to display. For example, the
following filter displays all `deploy` events for the `auth` service:

```text
lens_service = "auth" AND category = "deploys"
```
