[Chronosphere Lens](https://chronosphere.io/learn/empower-developer-effectiveness-in-the-cloud-native-age-with-chronosphere-lens/)
gives you visibility into the health and performance of your applications by
ingesting metrics, traces, and change events that you can observe using
[services](/observe/services) and [dashboards](/observe/dashboards).

Use Chronosphere Lens to review services and visually examine trends in telemetry
data at a high level. Dashboards help visualize data in more specific and custom
ways. Incorporate dashboards into your services to tie your data together in ways
that make sense for your observability teams and reduce time to mitigate.

## Services

Services pages provide opinionated displays of telemetry data that are the most
important to your organization. Chronosphere Observability Platform discovers
services automatically and provides efficient views into your app services to help
you discover ways to explore your data.

Service pages take advantage of other Observability Platform features, including
[tagged metrics](/overview/types/metrics), [queries](/investigate/querying),
[data visualization panels](/observe/dashboards/panels),
[teams](/administer/accounts-teams/teams), [collections](/administer/collections),
and [change events](/overview/types/change-events).

Use [pinned scopes](/navigate/pinned-scopes) to narrow your observed data, and to
keep filtering based on that scope as you navigate Observability Platform to triage
problems.

## Dashboards

Chronosphere Observability Platform dashboards target use cases relevant to service
and app monitoring. Analyze your telemetry data by creating visualizations of query
results that you can customize, filter, and focus within a dashboard. Use this
information to identify and act on trends, correlate changes in data to incidents,
and monitor microservice statuses in real time.

Observability Platform provides a group of
[predefined dashboards](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards), and the
ability to [create and customize dashboards](/observe/dashboards#create-a-dashboard)
tailored to the specific needs of your organization and the teams within it.

If your organization purchased change event tracking and distributed tracing, you
can overlay additional telemetry data on your dashboards to help expedite problem
resolution:

- [Enable change events in dashboards](/observe/enable-events/dashboards#standard-dashboards)
  to display change events as a lined annotation on your dashboard panels.
- [Query traces directly from a dashboard](/observe/dashboards/query-traces), which
  lets you search your trace data without having to navigate to Trace Explorer.

## Change events

Change events describe changes within your environment or Observability Platform
tenant at a specific time so you can answer questions like _When did a particular service
deploy last?_ or _Which alerts triggered in the last week?_
[Enable change events](/observe/enable-events) to overlay them on other areas of
Observability Platform, such as lined annotations on dashboard panels. This ability
to identify and isolate change events can help remediate issues faster and minimize
downstream impacts.

You can then [filter change events](/investigate/querying/filter-events) during
on-call triage to understand what changes occurred prior to the onset of an issue.

## Working together

When you're getting started using Observability Platform, your workflow might look
something like:

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<ServiceNavIcon /> System Overview <span aria-label="and then">></span> Services**.
1. Identify an interesting trend or incident.
1. [Explore panels](/observe/services/service-pages#explore-queries) in the service
   to display queries behind a data visualization.
1. [Create a dashboard](/observe/dashboards#create-a-dashboard) and add those queries
   to new panels.
1. [Edit the queries](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer#enter-and-run-a-query)
   and tailor the visualizations to your needs.

As you get better at identifying trends and incidents, you can turn those queries and
understanding of your telemetry data into monitors and alerts, reducing on-call
escalations and incidents.
