After [ingesting](/ingest) your telemetry data, Chronosphere Observability Platform
gives you access to all of your data to help identify issues and determine which
services are causing latency.

## Query data

Any aspect of Observability Platform that surfaces data to users requires
[querying](/investigate/querying). Dashboards, monitors, traces, and all other
data views query for selected metrics, labels, or tags. Consolidate metrics with
similar names or uses with
[derived telemetry](/investigate/querying/metrics/derived-telemetry).

## Analyze data

Use the provided tools in Observability Platform to
[analyze data](/investigate/analyze) and provide insights about your telemetry data.
This information helps identify performance issues, understand the value of your data
semantics, and highlight changes and their impacts.

## Configure alerts

When data spikes occur or services become unreliable or unresponsive, you need to
immediately alert the appropriate people to triage the issue.
[Configure alerts](/investigate/alerts) on monitors to query time series and receive
notifications when specific conditions are met.
