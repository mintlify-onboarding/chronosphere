{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


After you've [installed](/pipeline-install) Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline,
you can navigate the [Telemetry Pipeline web interface](https://core.calyptia.com/)
to access a variety of tools and features.

<Info>
For information about interacting with Telemetry Pipeline through a command-line
interface, see [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli).
</Info>

## Home

The Telemetry Pipeline home page includes quick links to common pages and
several embedded video tutorials.

## Core Instances

This page lists the [Core Instances](/pipelines/concepts#core-operators-and-core-instances)
that you've created and displays information about each, including:

- **Core Instance**: The name of that Core Instance.
- **Status**: The status of that Core Instance.
- **Pipelines Count**: The number of pipelines associated with that Core Instance.
- **Version**: The version of the [Core Operator](/pipelines/core-components)
  associated with that Core Instance.
- **Last Modification**: The date and time of the most recent changes to that
  Core Instance.

You can click <Icon icon="plus" />&nbsp;**Deploy a new Core Instance**
to [create a new Core Instance](/pipeline-install/create-instance).

To view more information about a specific Core Instance, to modify that Core Instance,
or to view or modify any of its associated pipelines, click the name of that Core Instance.
This opens the Core Instance details page.

### Core Instance details

This page displays information about a specific Core Instance, including its
name, tags, version, information about its Kubernetes environment, and any
associated pipelines.

Click **Edit** to modify the Core Instance's name and tags, or click
<Icon icon="square-pen" />&nbsp;**Advanced Settings**
to manage [files](/pipeline-configure/files) and
[secrets](/pipeline-configure/secrets).

In the **Kubernetes Namespaces** section, you can enable
[automated Kubernetes logging](/pipeline-data/automated-logging).

The **Data Pipelines** section lists the pipelines within that Core Instance and
displays information about each, including:

- **Name**: The name of that pipeline.
- **Status**: The status of that pipeline.
- **Workload**: The [workload type](/pipeline-configure/kubernetes/workloads)
  of that pipeline.
- **Version**: The [version](/pipelines/core-components) of the pipeline agent
  powering that pipeline. If a pipeline isn't using the latest agent version,
  an **Upgrade** is displayed, which you can click to navigate to the
  [pipeline details](#pipeline-details) page.
- **Uptime**: How long that pipeline has been running.
- **Last modified**: The date and time of the most recent changes to that
  pipeline.

You can also click **Create Data Pipeline**
to [create a new pipeline](/pipeline-data/create-modify).

To view more information about a specific pipeline or it modify its settings,
click the name of that pipeline. This opens the pipeline details page.

### Pipeline details

This page displays information about a specific pipeline, including its active
sources, destination, and endpoints.

Click **Edit** to open the pipeline builder, where you can add and configure
[source plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins),
[destination plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins), and
[processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules) for that pipeline.

Click <Icon icon="square-pen" />&nbsp;**Advanced Settings** to manage
that pipeline's advanced settings, including:

- [Replicas](/pipeline-configure/scaling)
- [Deployment strategy](/pipeline-configure/deployment-strategies)
- [Version](/pipelines/core-components) and [agent image type](/pipeline-configure/agent-image)
- [Files](/pipeline-configure/files)
- [Secrets](/pipeline-configure/secrets)

If a pipeline isn't using the latest agent [version](/pipelines/core-components),
an `Upgrade to <version> available` notice is displayed, and you can click
**Upgrade** to upgrade the pipeline to the latest version.

#### Pipeline output

In the **Pipeline Output** section, click **Get Latest Logs** to view operational logs generated
by that pipeline, including status changes and error messages. If your pipeline
has the [Standard output](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins/standard-output)
destination plugin, the telemetry data routed through your pipeline will also
print here.

<Info>
When you use **Pipeline Output** while the Standard output plugin is active,
your telemetry data is temporarily cached in the Telemetry Pipeline backend.
</Info>

## Monitoring

This page displays information about the performance and throughput of your
Core Instances and pipelines.

## Fleets

This page lists the [fleets](/fleets) that you've deployed and displays
information about each, including:

- **Fleet Name**: The name of that fleet.
- **Agent Type**: The [type of agent](/fleets/agent) that makes up that fleet.
- **Managed Agents**: The number of agents within that fleet.
- **Last Edit**: The date and time of the most recent changes to that fleet.

You can click <Icon icon="plus" />&nbsp;**Create new fleet**
to [create a new fleet](/fleets#create-a-fleet).

To view more information about a specific fleet, modify that fleet, or view
details about its associated agents, click the name of that fleet. This opens
the fleet details page.

### Fleet details

This page displays information about a specific fleet, including its name,
configuration settings, attached files, and any associated agents.

The **Agents List** section lists the agents within that fleet and displays
information about each, including:

- **Host Name**: The name of the machine where that agent is deployed.
- **Status**: The status of that agent.
- **Version**: The version of the Fluent Bit or Core Agent for that agent.
- **Platform**: The operating system where the agent is deployed.
- **Architecture**: The architecture of the environment where the agent is deployed.
- **Last Edit**: The date and time of the most recent changes to that agent.

You can click <Icon icon="note-sticky-plus" />&nbsp;**Attach New File**
to add a file to that fleet, or <Icon icon="circle-plus" />&nbsp;**Add Agent**
to [add a new agent](/fleets/add-agent-to-fleet).

## Parser playground

The parser playground lets you preview the effect of [parsers](/pipeline-data/parsers)
on your telemetry data. The **Examples** column includes several of the default
parsers included with Telemetry Pipeline, and you can test your own custom parsers by
pasting any string into the **Regular Expression** field.

To preview the result of a specified parser, either enter raw log data into the
**Enter Your Test String** field or use the pre-populated data, then click **Parse**.
The **Output** pane displays the resulting structured data.

After you've created and testing a custom parser in the parser playground, you can
[add that parser to a `parsers.conf` file](/pipeline-data/parsers#custom-parsers).

## Pipeline builder playground

The pipeline builder playground lets you construct pipelines in a sandbox environment.
You can use this tool to configure [source plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins/source-plugins),
[destination plugins](/pipeline-data/plugins/destination-plugins), and
[processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules), and then preview the resulting pipeline.
The **Advanced Settings** section also generates a [YAML configuration file](/pipeline-configure/config-files)
from your choices.

This tool is functionally identical to the pipeline builder for real production
environments, but any plugins or processing rules you configure here won't go into
effect and won't affect your telemetry data. If you'd like to export your choices
for later use, including in a production environment, click **Export** to save a
copy of the pipeline's configuration file to your device.

## Processing rules playground

The processing rules playground lets you create and test [processing rules](/pipeline-data/processing-rules)
in a sandbox environment, including custom Lua scripts.

This tool is functionally identical to the processing rules builder for real production
environments, but the playground environment is isolated from the internet and
has no access to internal Telemetry Pipeline resources. Any processing rules you
create here won't affect your pipelines, Core Instances, or telemetry data.

If you'd like to save your playground processing rules for later use,
including in a production environment, click <Icon icon="inbox-out" />&nbsp;**Export**
to save a JSON template file to your device. You can also click
<Icon icon="hexagon-check" />&nbsp;**Save** to save your template
within the Telemetry Pipeline web interface, which makes that template available
to any other users in your current project.

## Settings

This page displays information about your current Telemetry Pipeline project.
You can also [generate new API keys](/pipeline-cli/authenticate)
and view keys that you previously generated.

## Team
