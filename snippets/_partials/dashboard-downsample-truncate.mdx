  the raw query. */}

- **Truncation strategy**: Truncation strategy to apply to the query. This modifies
  the raw query. Observability Platform selects the best strategy for fit when
  possible, and displays `Auto` as the selected strategy.

  Available strategies are:

  - `Auto`
  - `Off`
  - `Avg`
  - `Min`
  - `Max`

  Changing your truncation strategy adds truncation information as additional bands
  or bars on your chart and details into the legend.
