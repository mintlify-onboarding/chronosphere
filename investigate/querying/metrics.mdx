When you create dashboards, monitors, or use the
[Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer), you use a query to select and
filter the metrics in which you're interested, and then apply functions to them. When
querying data, you can use [regular expressions](/investigate/querying/regular-expressions)
or [glob syntax](/investigate/querying/glob-syntax) where supported.

<RegexGlob />

Chronosphere Observability Platform supports these languages for querying metrics
data. Contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) to configure the data sources you want
to use.

- **[Prometheus Query Language (PromQL)](/investigate/querying/promql)**: Used with
  Prometheus-compatible metrics. Default.
- **Graphite**: Used with StatsD metrics data. Enabled on request.

  <Info>
  Although Chronosphere supports both PromQL and Graphite, this document provides
    information only about the use of PromQL. For more details about Graphite, see the
    [Graphite documentation](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.0/functions.html).
  </Info>

To help construct, optimize, and debug queries, use the
[Query Builder](/investigate/querying/metrics/query-builder) or the
[classic Query Builder](/investigate/querying/metrics/builder). To analyze expensive
queries and understand their relative load, use the
[Query Analyzer](/investigate/analyze/query-analyzer).
