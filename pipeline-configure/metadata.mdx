Use the information on this page to access pipeline metadata.

## Get pipeline IDs

After you [create a pipeline](/pipeline-data/create-modify), Telemetry
Pipeline assigns that pipeline a unique numerical ID.

To retrieve a list of IDs for all pipelines associated with a
[Core Instance](/pipelines/concepts#core-instance),
run the following [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli) command:

```shell copy
calyptia get pipelines --core-instance INSTANCE --show-ids
```

Replace _`INSTANCE`_ with the name of your Core Instance.

## Back up pipeline configuration files

> Requires Pipeline CLI version 3.17.0 or later.

You can run the following script to back up the [configuration files](/pipeline-configure/config-files)
for each pipeline across all of your Core Instances:

{/* markdownlint-disable MD013 */}

```shell copy
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chronosphereio/calyptia-cli/refs/heads/main/dump-all-pipelines.sh | bash
```

{/* markdownlint-enable MD013 */}

The resulting configuration files are stored in your current working directory,
with a subfolder for each Core Instance that contains the configuration files
for all of its associated pipelines.
