Chronosphere Observability Platform provides tools to analyze both your telemetry data
and queries.

When your data is streaming to Observability Platform, use the Live Telemetry
Analyzer to view incoming [metrics](/investigate/analyze/telemetry-analyzer) and
[traces](/investigate/analyze/trace-analyzer) grouped by label and their relative
frequency. Use this real-time view to learn more about how often your applications
emit data, troubleshoot spikes in ingest rates, and ensure the Collector is aware of
particular data.

When you need to understand the value a metric is providing, the
[Usage Analyzer](/investigate/analyze/usage) helps identify metrics that
your teams find the most useful, or metrics you might consider consolidating.
[Logs Usage](/investigate/analyze/logs-usage) displays the volume of log data passing
through Observability Platform, including its utility compared to other patterns.

Use the [Query Analyzer](/investigate/analyze/query-analyzer) to identify
load-intensive queries and determine whether to make changes to reduce slow queries.

When investigating issues, use
[Differential Diagnosis (DDx)](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis)
to analyze all available dimensions in your metrics or traces to highlight what
changed, and find what's broken faster. DDx lets developers resolve service
performance issues without writing queries or needing knowledge of the entire system.
