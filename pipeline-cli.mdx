{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


Pipeline CLI is a Chronosphere-supplied app that lets you manage Chronosphere
Telemetry Pipeline from the command line. For example, you can use Pipeline CLI to
[create and modify pipelines](/pipeline-data/create-modify),
[create fleets](/fleets#create-a-fleet), and
[install a Core Operator](/pipeline-install/install-operator/) in your Kubernetes
cluster.

## Get started

To install Pipeline CLI, [Install Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli/install).

After you install Pipeline CLI, you'll need to [authenticate](/pipeline-cli/authenticate)
with Chronosphere.

## Command autocompletion

You can add support for shell command autocompletion with Pipeline CLI for the Bash,
Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell by using the `calyptia completion` command.

This section provides detailed steps for Bash and Zsh on macOS. For Linux-specific
details and instructions for Fish and PowerShell, see the output of
`calyptia completion --help`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Bash" id="autocomplete-bash">

1. Update or install `bash-completion`:

   ```shell
   brew install bash-completion
   ```

1. In a shell initialization script, such as `~/.bashrc`, add the following:

   ```shell
   source "$(brew --prefix bash-completion)/etc/bash_completion"
   eval "$(calyptia completion bash)"
   ```

1. Restart the shell.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Zsh" id="autocomplete-zsh">

1. Go to your Zsh `site-functions` folder.

   - If you installed Zsh with Homebrew, the path is
     `/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions`.
   - If you use the default macOS Zsh, the path is
     `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions`.

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   calyptia completion zsh > _calyptia
   ```

1. Ensure your `~/.zshrc` file has
   [`compinit`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html) added.
   If you use `oh-my-zsh`, it adds that for you.

1. Restart the shell.
