To send CircleCI events to Chronosphere Observability Platform, create a webhook
within CircleCI and include your API key to authenticate with Observability Platform.

## Obtain an API token

Before sending events from CircleCI, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) to
obtain an API token to use when authenticating your third-party app with
Observability Platform.

   Replace _`ADDRESS`_ with your company name prefixed to your Observability Platform

   _`MY_COMPANY`_`.chronosphere.io`.
