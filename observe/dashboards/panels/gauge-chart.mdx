A _gauge chart_ visualizes numeric data returned by a [query](/investigate/querying).
The chart depicts a specified value, such as the last numeric value in a time series
or the result's sum, average, or minimum or maximum value, within a radial gauge
representing a specified range.

Each gauge displays its series name or alias, the configured numeric value representing
that series, and an indicator pointing to where that value falls within its range.

Two bars on the gauge indicate the gauge's thresholds by their colors:

- A thick bar indicates in which threshold the value falls.
- A thin bar indicates the thresholds' ranges on the gauge.

You can visualize the results of multiple queries in a single gauge chart panel
to visually compare them. This can help you quickly identify whether values from
related queries, such as resource usage of different services or cumulative failure
and error counts, are within expected thresholds.

To create a gauge chart or learn more about the configuration options common
to all panels, see [Panels](/observe/dashboards/panels).

## Gauge chart queries

Gauge charts use one or more
[queries](/observe/dashboards/panels#change-a-panels-query) to retrieve data to
visualize. Gauge charts use the following query **Options** to refine the
displayed information, depending on your **Datasource**:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Metrics (Prometheus)">

- <DashboardSeriesNaming />
- **Type**: The [PromQL query](/investigate/querying/promql#basic-querying)
  type: **Instant**, or **Range**.
<DashboardDownsampleTruncate />

</Tab>
<Tab title="Logs">

<DashboardSeriesNaming />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure a gauge chart

You can configure a gauge chart by [modifying its **Settings**](/observe/dashboards/panels#edit-a-panel).

Any changes you make in the panel's Settings tab are immediately reflected in the
**Preview** pane, but take effect only when you click **Apply** in the **Edit panel**
interface and then **Save** the dashboard.

Observability Platform doesn't fully support directly editing a panel's JSON
representation and recommends configuring panels in the user interface. Use the JSON
representation only for managing your configuration as code with tools such as
[Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl) and [Terraform](/tooling/infrastructure/terraform).

### Modify a gauge chart's visual representation

The **Visual** section in a gauge chart's **Settings** tab controls how Observability
Platform visualizes data in the gauge chart.

- **Mode**: Select a display mode: **Gauge** or **Bar**.
- **Sort**: Determines how the gauge chart sorts the rendered bars.
  - **Default** sorts in the original data order.
  - **Ascending** sorts from the lowest value at the top, to the highest
    value at the bottom. **Descending** sorts in the opposite direction.

### Modify a gauge chart's units and formatting

The **Unit and formatting** section in a table's **Settings** tab defines how the
gauge interprets and displays the panel's query units.

<DashboardUnits />

### Modify a gauge chart's thresholds

The **Thresholds** section in a gauge chart's **Settings** tab defines values where
Observability Platform renders each threshold range. You can define threshold values
as either absolute numeric values or percentiles.

The threshold's **Mode** defines whether all thresholds use **Absolute** numeric
values, which is the default mode, or **Percent** values. Percent values are relative
to the Y axis' minimum and maximum.

Observability Platform assumes that the **Default** threshold always starts at the
left-most beginning of the gauge's range and end at the first threshold value. Each
subsequent threshold value defines the end of the previous threshold's range.
Observability Platform also assumes the last threshold range begins at the last
threshold value and ends at the right-most ending of the gauge's range.

To create a new threshold value:

1. Click the plus sign (+) in the **Thresholds** section header.
1. In the field that displays, enter a value where you want Observability Platform to
   end the previous threshold range and begin the next range.
1. Click either **Absolute** or **Percent** to select the mode you want the panel to
   display.

   <Warning>
If you choose **Absolute** as the **Mode** and select any unit other than
   **Percent**, you must enter a maximum value in the **Max** field for the gauge
   chart to correctly display data. Otherwise, the chart has no upper limit and will
   display data incorrectly.
</Warning>

1. Optional: Click the color indicator, depicted as a colored circle, to open a
   color selector and choose a color for the threshold line.
1. Optional: Click the caret (>) to expand the threshold definition, and enter text
   in the **Message** field to display on the chart if the threshold is met.

   To display only the text from the **Message** field, click the
   **Show only message** toggle.

1. In the **Edit panel** dialog, click **Apply** to save your changes.
1. After you've finished editing the panel, click **Save** on the dashboard to save
   your changes.

To delete a threshold value, click the caret (>) to expand the threshold definition,
and then click the
**<Icon icon="trash" alt="Delete icon"/> Delete** icon on its corresponding
row of the Thresholds section.
