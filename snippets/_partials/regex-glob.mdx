Regular expression syntax and glob syntax are not interchangeable. Chronosphere
Observability Platform supports only one of these query matching patterns in
supported areas of the product. For example,
[drop rules](/control/shaping/rules/drop-rules#create-a-drop-rule) support glob
syntax, whereas [recording rules](/control/shaping/rules/recording) support
regular expression syntax.
