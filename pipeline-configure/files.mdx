'og:description': Add files to pipelines in Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline.
---
{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


In addition to the [YAML configuration file](/pipeline-configure/config-files)
that govern a pipeline's settings, you can optionally add other kinds of files
to pipelines, such as [parsers](/pipeline-data/parsers), certificates, and
[custom Lua](/pipeline-data/processing-rules/custom-lua) scripts.

<Info>
Due to Kubernetes [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)
storage limitations, the total size of a pipeline and its associated resources
can't exceed 1&nbsp;MiB. This limit includes the combined size of
[configuration files](/pipeline-configure/config-files), [secrets](/pipeline-configure/secrets),
[parsers](/pipeline-data/parsers), and any other files.
</Info>

## Add a file to a pipeline

To add a file to a pipeline, use one of these methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web interface" id="add-file-pipeline-ui">

1. Sign in to [Telemetry Pipeline](https://core.calyptia.com/).
1. Open the project that contains the pipeline that you want to add a file to.
1. Go to **Core Instances**, then click the name of the Core Instance associated
   with the pipeline that you want to add a file to.
1. Under **Data Pipelines**, click the name of the pipeline that you want to add
   a file to.
1. Click <Icon icon="square-pen" />&nbsp;**Advanced Settings**.
1. Under **Pipeline Files**, click **Upload File**.
1. Use one of these methods to upload a file:
   - Click **Select File** to choose a file from your device.
   - Enter a value in **File name** field and add content to the large text field to create
   a new file with that name and content.
1. Optional: To encrypt your file, select the **Encrypt file** checkbox.
1. Click **Upload File**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="add-file-pipeline-cli">

Run the following [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli) command:

```shell
calyptia create pipeline_file --pipeline PIPELINE --file FILEPATH
```

Replace the following:

- _`PIPELINE`_: The name or [unique ID](/pipeline-configure/metadata#get-pipeline-ids)
  of your pipeline.
- _`FILEPATH`_: The path to the file to add, relative to your current directory.

To encrypt your file, add the `--encrypt-files` flag.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add a file to a Core Instance

<Info>
Adding a file to a Core Instance doesn't circumvent the 1&nbsp;MiB resource limit
for pipelines. If you add a file to a Core Instance, that file becomes a resource
for every pipeline associated with that Core Instance, which increases the resource
utilization for each pipeline accordingly.
</Info>

You can also add a file to a [Core Instance](/pipelines/concepts#core-operators-and-core-instances),
which makes that file available to all pipelines associated with that Core Instance. To do
so, use one of these methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web interface" id="add-file-instance-ui">

1. Sign in to [Telemetry Pipeline](https://core.calyptia.com/).
1. Open the project that contains the Core Instance that you want to add a file to.
1. Go to **Core Instances**, then click the name of the Core Instance that
   you want to add a file to.
1. Click <Icon icon="square-pen" />&nbsp;**Advanced Settings**.
1. Under **Pipeline Files**, click **Upload File**.
1. Use one of these methods to upload a file:
   - Click **Select File** to choose a file from your device.
   - Enter a value in **File name** field and add content to the large text field to create
   a new file with that name and content.
1. Optional: To encrypt your file, select the **Encrypt file** checkbox.
1. Click **Upload File**.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="add-file-instance-cli">

Run the following [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli) command:

```shell
calyptia create core_instance_file --core-instance INSTANCE --file FILEPATH
```

Replace the following:

- _`INSTANCE`_: The name of your Core Instance.
- _`FILEPATH`_: The path to the file to add, relative to your current directory.

To encrypt your file, add the `--encrypt-files` flag.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Reference a file

After you've added a file to a pipeline, you can reference it in a
pipeline's [configuration file](/pipeline-configure/config-files) by using the
following variable:

```text
{{ files.FILENAME }}
```

Replace _`FILENAME`_ with the name of your file.

## File encryption

For encrypted files, Telemetry Pipeline uses RSA‑OAEP encryption with a 2048-bit key.
Files are unencrypted by default, but you can choose to encrypt a file when you
add to it a pipeline or Core Instance.
