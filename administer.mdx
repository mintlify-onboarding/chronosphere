Administrative users focus on observability tools so that developers can use those
tools to monitor and maintain the health of their distributed system. As an
administrative user, you might focus on one or more of the following tasks.

## Cost control

Manage license consumption by
[reviewing licensing dashboards](/observe/dashboards/chronosphere-managed-dashboards#licensing-overview)
to identify usage trends and avoid exceeding your organization's licensing limits.
Use the Chronosphere Control Plane to
[shape your metric data](/control/shaping), downsample data, and reduce the
amount of data you persist. You can also
[create sampling rules](/control/sampling) to manage the tracing data
you keep and discard.

## Data collection

[Ingest telemetry data](/ingest) into Chronosphere Observability Platform, which can
include metrics, traces, and change events. Your Collector selection depends on the
data you plan to ingest. Chronosphere recommends using the Chronosphere Collector,
but can also ingest data from the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Data usability

[Explore your data](/investigate) to understand where you can normalize,
sanitize, and optimize telemetry data to make it usable for developers and to filter
out less useful data. [Analyze usage metrics](/overview/types/metrics) and
implement aggregation rules to improve the quality and reduce the cardinality of
stored metrics data.

## Platform usability

Create and manage [collections](/administer/collections) to group Observability
Platform resources associated with a service or feature you want to monitor. You
create [teams](/administer/accounts-teams/teams) to organize accounts into groups and
define permissions for sensitive management and administrative operations. A team's
accounts have shared responsibility for individual services, which Observability
Platform represents as collections.
