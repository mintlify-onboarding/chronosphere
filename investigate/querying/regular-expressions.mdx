All regular expressions in Prometheus use [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).
Chronosphere Observability Platform supports RE2 syntax compatibility with Prometheus
for queries using regular expressions in the following areas:

- [Changes Explorer](/investigate/querying/filter-events)
- [Dashboards](/observe/dashboards)
- [Lens configuration](/administer/service-discovery)
- [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer)
- [Monitors](/investigate/alerts/monitors#use-annotations-with-monitors)
- [Muting rules](/investigate/alerts/muting-rules#match-on-values-using-regular-expressions)
- [Recording rules](/control/shaping/rules/recording)
- [Trace Explorer](/investigate/querying/traces)

<Info>
Because the implementation of this parser is customized, the syntax might vary in
some instances.
