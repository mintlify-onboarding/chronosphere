[Environment variable expansions](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/configure#environment-variable-expansion) and
  [Prometheus relabel rule](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config) regular expression capture group references can use the same syntax.
  For example, `${1}` is valid in both contexts.

  If your relabel configuration uses Prometheus relabel rule regular expression capture
  group references, and they are in the `${1}` format, escape the syntax by adding an
  extra `$` character to the expression such as `$${1}`.
