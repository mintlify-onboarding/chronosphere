{/* -- dri: Lynette Miles -- */}


Chronosphere Observability Platform supports a range of standard _time units_:

| Unit         | Abbreviation |
|--------------|--------------|
| Nanoseconds  | `ns`           |
| Microseconds | `mu`           |
| Milliseconds | `ms`           |
| Seconds      | `s`            |
| Minutes      | `m`            |
| Hours        | `h`            |
| Days         | `d`            |
| Weeks        | `w`            |
| Months       | `M`            |
| Years        | `y`            |

The abbreviations for minutes (`m`) and months (`M`) are case-sensitive.

Additionally, times that use 12-hour clocks designate morning hours with `AM` and
evening hours with `PM`. These abbreviations prefer uppercase and don't use periods.

Certain features, such as
[dashboard time ranges](/observe/dashboards/customization/time-ranges), display
only second and larger units and automatically convert units accordingly. For example,
dashboard time ranges automatically convert a manually entered custom time range
of `1ms` to `0.001 seconds`.

Observability Platform also automatically converts units in certain display-only
contexts. For example, [dashboard panels](/observe/dashboards/panels) might convert
the numeric values of data points depending on the unit type you designate in a
panel's **Unit <span aria-label="and then">></span> Time** setting and the context
of that value.

If you select the `Nanoseconds` unit, Observability Platform interprets a numeric
value of `120` for a data point as 120 nanoseconds and displays it as `120ns`. However,
if you select `Days` as the time unit, Observability Platform interprets the same
value as 120 days, converts it to the larger unit of months, and displays it as
`4 months`.
