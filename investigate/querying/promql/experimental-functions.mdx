Prometheus makes experimental functions and operators available behind a feature flag.
The Prometheus project might change the name, syntax, or semantics of experimental
functions or remove them entirely.

Observability Platform accepts a subset of PromQL experimental functions determined
to be relatively stable, and which provide significant value while also being at
a low risk of being removed by the Prometheus project.

When the upstream Prometheus project makes breaking changes, Observability Platform
will either preserve backward compatibility if possible or notify users and provide
a deprecation timeline.

The following experimental functions are available in Observability Platform:

## `double_exponential_smoothing()`

Use the `double_exponential_smoothing()` experimental function to smooth a time series
based on the importance you assign to older data and possible trends. See the
[PromQL documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#double_exponential_smoothing).

## `holt_winters()` (deprecated)

As of Prometheus 3.0, this function is named `double_exponential_smoothing()`.
Although Observability Platform aliases `holt_winters()` to provide backward
compatibility, you should replace it with the new name to avoid issues when
Observability Platform removes the `holt_winters()` alias.

## `histogram_*()` (native histogram functions)

All Prometheus native histogram functions remain behind a feature flag in the Prometheus
project. Observability Platform has made the native histogram functions generally
available for users to query OpenTelemetry exponential histograms and Prometheus
native histograms.

For details on using these functions in Observability Platform and examples, as well
as other supported histogram types, see
[Querying histograms](/investigate/querying/promql#querying-histograms).
