To send GitHub events to Chronosphere Observability Platform, create a webhook
within GitHub and include your API key to authenticate with Observability Platform.
For more information, refer to
[webhook events and payloads](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads)
in the GitHub documentation.

## Obtain an API token

Before sending events from GitHub, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) to obtain
an API token for use with authenticating your third-party app with Observability
Platform.

<EventsToken />

## Create a GitHub webhook

To send GitHub events to Observability Platform:

1. In GitHub, open the repository you want to configure a webhook for.
1. Click **Settings**.
1. Under **Code and automation**, click **Webhooks**.
1. In the **Add webhook** window, in the **Payload URL** field, enter:

   ```text /TENANT/
   https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/api/v1/data/events/receiver/github
   ```

   Replace _`TENANT`_ with your organization name from your Observability Platform
   tenant.

1. Select **application/json** as the **Content type**.
1. In the **Secret** field, enter the API token you obtained from Chronosphere
   Support.
1. Choose **Let me select individual events**, and then select **Deployment** and
   **Deployment Status** as the events to trigger the webhook.
1. Save your webhook.

## Map GitHub events to Observability Platform events

After creating a GitHub webhook to send events to Observability Platform, you can use
Observability Platform or the CreateEvent API to
[create change events](/observe/enable-events/use-events#create-change-events).

Observability Platform automatically maps the GitHub payload to change events in
Observability Platform. You can't customize how the payload maps to change events. If
you want to modify how the GitHub payload gets mapped, contact
[Chronosphere Support](/support).

The following table indicates the fields and values required to create a GitHub event
in Observability Platform:

| Field         | Value |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `category`    | `deploys` |
| `type`        | `deploy_ACTION` |
| `source`      | `github` |
| `happened_at` | `TIMESTAMP` |
| `title`       | `TITLE` |

Replace the following:

- _`ACTION`_: The type of `deploy` event to create, such as `deploy_start`,
  `deploy_in_progress`, or `deploy_end`.
- _`TIMESTAMP`_: The time event occurred, which must be between 24 hours in the
  past or 24 hours in the future. Defaults to `now` if not specified.
- _`TITLE`_: A short description of the event that occurred, such as a commit
  message of a code deploy.

The following sample request creates a `deploy` event from GitHub with a `type` of
`deploy_start`. Observability Platform maps the `environment`, `deploy.sha`, and
`deploy.log_url` labels by default.

Replace the following:

- _`TENANT`_: Your organization name from your Observability Platform tenant.
- _`CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN`_: The API token for authenticating with Observability Platform.

```shell /TENANT/ /CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN/
curl --request POST \
  --url https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/api/v1/data/events/receiver/github \
  --header "API-Token: $CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN" \
  --data '{
  "event": {
    "category": "deploys",
    "happened_at": "2024-07-24T14:15:22Z",
    "payload": {},
    "labels": {
      "environment": "staging",
      "deploy.sha": "fr123456f5g1234c2e01c12345f5bc1a2bf0g40"
      "deploy.log_url": "https://link_to_github_deploy_event"
    },
    "source": "github",
    "title": "Deploy to staging environment",
    "type": "deploy_start"
  }
}'
```
