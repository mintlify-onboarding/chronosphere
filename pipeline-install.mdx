You can install Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline in a Linux environment or inside
a Kubernetes cluster. To complete this installation process, you'll need to
deploy several components that work together to form a functional Telemetry
Pipeline deployment. These components include a [Core Operator](/pipelines/concepts#core-operator),
a [Core Instance](/pipelines/concepts#core-instance), and any number of pipelines.

<Info>
Telemetry Pipeline doesn't offer native support for macOS or Windows. However,
you can install Telemetry Pipeline on a Linux virtual machine or Kubernetes cluster
running on a macOS or Windows device.

You can also use [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli) in macOS and Windows to manage
pipelines deployed on an external Linux environment or Kubernetes cluster.

## Install a Core Operator

First, you must [install a Core Operator](/pipeline-install/install-operator) in
each cluster or environment where you want to use Telemetry Pipeline. These Core
Operators are [Kubernetes operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
that create and modify pipelines.

## Create a Core Instance

Next, for each Core Operator you install, you'll need to
[create a Core Instance](/pipeline-install/create-instance) in the corresponding
Kubernetes cluster or Linux environment. Core Instances create the underlying
resources for your pipelines and sync those resources with the Telemetry Pipeline
backend.

## Create and manage pipelines

After you install a Core Operator and create a Core Instance, you can
[create pipelines](/pipeline-data/create-modify) in that environment and
[configure their behavior](/pipeline-configure).
