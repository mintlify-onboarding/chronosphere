To send Harness events to Chronosphere Observability Platform, create a webhook
within Harness and include your API key to authenticate with Observability
Platform.

## Obtain an API token

Before sending events from Harness, contact [Chronosphere Support](/support) to
obtain an API token for use with authenticating your third-party app with
Observability Platform.

<EventsToken />

## Create a Harness webhook

To send Harness events to Observability Platform:

1. In Harness, [create a webhook](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/notify-users-of-pipeline-events).

1. Select **Add a Notification Rule**.
   Observability Platform supports the following Harness events:
   - `PipelineSuccess`
   - `PipelineFailed`
   - `PipelineStart`

      Observability Platform listens for `PipelineStart`, `PipelineSuccess`,
      and `PipelineFailed` events. There can be several hours between a
      `PipelineStart` event and a deployment. Chronosphere recommends using
      `PipelineSuccess` or `PipelineFailed` unless start events are critical
      information.
1. Select a [**Webhook notification method**](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/notify-users-of-pipeline-events/#webhook-notifications).
1. Enter the following URL:
   `https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/api/v1/data/events/receiver/harness`

   Replace _`TENANT`_ with your Observability Platform tenant name.

1. Click **+ Add Headers** to add the following custom header:

   ```text
   X-Harness-Token: CHRONOSPHERE_HARNESS_TOKEN
   ```

   Replace _`CHRONOSPHERE_HARNESS_TOKEN`_ with the API token obtained from
   Chronosphere support.
1. Click **Finish**.
