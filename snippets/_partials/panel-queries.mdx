
<Warning>
All panel types except Markdown and Service topology use queries.

Queries that return an extremely large number of data points or invalid results
can result in panel errors. For example, a query might return an error for exceeding
server resource limits.

Observability Platform reports these errors with an icon that appears in the corner
of the **Preview** pane of the **Add panel** or **Edit panel** interfaces, or on the
panel when viewing it on the dashboard. Hold the pointer over the icon to view the
error message.
