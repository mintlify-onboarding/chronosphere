Chronosphere Observability Platform provides a structured interface for creating
and editing [service level objectives](/observe/slo) (SLOs).

This page provides a reference to this management interface. For conceptual information
and best practices in designing SLOs within Observability Platform, see
[Design service level objectives](/observe/slo/design).

## Create a new SLO

When you create a new SLO, Observability Platform creates new metrics that it uses
in the SLO's reporting, alerting, and visualizations. These metrics are prefixed
with `lens:slo`, and you can also query and chart them in your own dashboards.

## Define an SLO

The **SLO Definition** drawer (also called the **Create SLO** drawer when creating a
new SLO) provides the following sections, each containing options that define the
SLO's parameters. The **[SLO preview](#slo-preview)** drawer and **Code Config** tab
update as you fill or change the **SLO Definition**.

### SLO information

<Warning>
Changes you make to your SLO's **Name** can also unexpectedly change its SLI's definition,
which causes an [error budget reset](#avoid-unintentional-budget-resets). An unintentional
budget reset can destructively change how your SLO represents the service's performance
against its objective.

Ensure that a budget reset is an acceptable outcome **before** you change this field
in an existing SLO.
</Warning>

In the **SLO information** section, complete these fields:

- **Name**: The SLO name.
- **Owner**: The service or collection that owns this SLO.
- **Description**: User-defined text to describe this SLO's purpose. This appears
  in the SLO page's **SLO information** section. Use the description to describe
  to other users what this SLO measures and which downstream users or systems
  might be affected if the SLO is breached.
- **Runbooks**: A name and URL for any runbooks used when this SLO triggers.
  These are displayed as links in the SLO page's **SLO information** section.

### Alerting

In the **Alerting** section, complete these fields:

- Alerting is enabled by default. Toggle **Alerting enabled** to disable alerts
  on this SLO.
  - Select a [**Notification policy**](/investigate/alerts/notifications/policies).
    Observability Platform then displays the selected policy's details.
    - When using the **Default Policy**, this section displays the policy defined
      for the selected **Owner**.
    - When using **Select Policy**, you can choose a different policy than the
      default.
  - <a id="burn-rate" ></a>Customize the **Burn rate alert configuration**, if necessary.
    This configuration is hidden if alerting is disabled.

    Burn rate alert configuration sets the criteria that determine when the SLO
    triggers alerts, and of which severity the alerts report. The default burn rate
    definition applies industry best practices for error budget consumption.

    For example, when your error budget consumption reaches `2%` over the last
    `1h` (one hour) **Long window** and the error rate is still high over the last
    `5m` (five minute) **Short window**, the SLO fires a critical **Severity** alert.
    When the problem no longer exists over the last five minutes, the alert resolves.

    For a full explanation, see [Multiwindow, Multi-Burn-Rate Alerts](https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/).

    You can add an optional **Notification label** to these alerts, and can add
    additional criteria by clicking **+ Add row**.

### SLO definition

<Warning>
Changes you make to your SLO's **Queries** can also unexpectedly change your SLI's
definition, which causes an [error budget reset](#avoid-unintentional-budget-resets).
An unintentional budget reset can destructively change how your SLO represents the
service's performance against its objective.

Ensure that a budget reset is an acceptable outcome **before** you change these
fields in an existing SLO.
</Warning>

Create the **SLO definition**, which defines the core criteria the SLO measures.

1. Define the **Objective (%)** as a percentile value with up to four decimal places.
   For example, `99.9995`.
1. Define the **Time window** using standard Chronosphere [time unit syntax](/overview/concepts/time-units).
   The default and recommended value is `4w` (4 weeks).
1. Select the SLO's **Measurement type**.
   - **Error ratio** SLOs measure the objective against the percentage of measurements
     that report errors over the entire time window. The SLO measures its error budget
     as the percentage of error responses remaining in the time window before
     the objective is breached.
   - **Time slice** SLOs repeatedly measure intervals, or time slices, within the
     time window and flags them based on a defined threshold. The overall objective
     then measures the ratio of failed time slices rather than the total number
     of errors.
     
     For instance, a time slice SLO might flag one-minute time slices where availability
     fails to reach a given threshold, and the overall objective is measured against
     the percentage of failed time slices over the entire time window. The SLO measures
     its error budget as the remaining amount of time during which time slice failures
     would breach the objective.
1. Define whether the **Query type** returns **Errors** or **Successes**.
1. Enter a query that returns the number of errors (**Error query**), successes
   (**Success query**), or rate of failures during a time slice (**Time slice definition**).
1. <a id="template-variables" ></a>Conditionally use the following template variables
   when applicable:

   - `{{.Window}}`: Use this variable in place of the time interval to dynamically
     assign the time interval value on the SLO details page. This placeholder
     computes the optimal window size to fulfill this SLO based on the input
     time window and burn rates. Using the default values should normally resolve
     to `5m` (five minutes).

     If your query has a `rate`, you should use `{​{​.Window}}`. However, gauges
     can't use `{​{​.Window}}`
   - `{{.GroupBy}}`: Use this variable in place of `group by` statements in the
     query to create a column for each label name defined in the **Dimensions**
     section. This placeholder substitutes all of the unique values in dimensions
     and signal groupings as a comma-separated list. It provides a place that defines
     the unique values and reduces mismatched queries.

     Observability Platform doesn't prevent you from managing the two lists without
     `{{.GroupBy}}`, but the lists should be identical in the error or success queries
     and total queries. Those lists should also match the lists in dimensions and
     signal groupings.

     If your query has a `by (...)` clause, use `by ({​{​.GroupBy}})`.
   - `{​{​.AdditionalFilters}}`: Use this variable in place of long lists of selectors
     in your SLO queries. This placeholder substitutes all the filters added
     in the **Additional filters** section.

     This allows both sharing a single list of filters for both queries if the list
     is long. `{​{​.AdditionalFilters}}` can also help when templating SLOs in
     [configuration as code](/tooling/gitops) workflows, because you can provide
     different values based on inputs without needing to directly manipulate the
     query.

     Observability Platform doesn't block you from managing the two lists of selectors
     in your PromQL queries. However, if additional filters are added to the **Additional filters**
     section, it's expected that you'll use the variable at least once.

     If your queries have a `metric{...}` where `...` is identical, consider using
     `metric{{.AdditionalFilters}}`.
   - `{{.TimeSlice}}`: Use this variable to reference the selected time slice interval
     in the query.

   For example:

   ```text
   sum by ({{.GroupBy}})(rate(metric[{{.Window}}]))
   ```

   When `cluster` and `namespace` are used as dimensions, the effective query is:

   ```text
   sum by (cluster, namespace)(rate(metric[5m]))
   ```

   In a time slice SLO, use `{{.TimeSlice}}` instead of `{{.Window}}` to return
   successful or failed slices:

   ```text
   sum by ({{.GroupBy}})(rate(metric[{{.TimeSlice}}]))
   ```
1. In time slice SLOs, complete the fields within the sentence that defines the
   objective:
   - Choose an interval from the first dropdown, which defaults to `1 minute`.
   - Choose an operator from the second dropdown, which defaults to greater than or
     equal to (`>=`).
   - Enter a **Threshold** that, when combined with the operator, determines whether
     the SLO considers a time slice to be a success.

#### Dimensions, signals, and filters

<Warning>
When you add or remove **Dimensions** and **Additional filters** from your SLO,
Observability Platform can also unexpectedly change its SLI's definition, which
causes an [error budget reset](#avoid-unintentional-budget-resets). An unintentional
budget reset can destructively change how your SLO represents the service's performance
against its objective.

Ensure that a budget reset is an acceptable outcome **before** you change these
fields in an existing SLO.
</Warning>

Refine your query using **Dimensions, signals, and filters**.

Use **Dimensions** to generate a time series per combination of labels entered.

1. Toggle **Alert by series** to create alerts for each time series in the selected
   metric.
1. Enter a **Label name**.
1. Select the **Use as signal** checkbox to create a signal.

   The signal indicates which labels to alert on. For example, if the base query
   is `sum by (cluster) (rate(metric_name{}))`, you can add dimensions to make the
   effective query `sum by (cluster, namespace, instance) (rate(metric_name{}))`
   but only have `cluster` and `namespace` added as signals to get an alert for
   each `cluster` and `namespace` combination.
1. Add **Additional filters** to reduce the number of metrics used by the SLO.

   To add a filter:

   1. Click the **Add label filter** field.
   1. Enter a label, select an operator, and enter a value.
   1. Click the <Icon icon="check" /> check icon to add the filter, or
      the <Icon icon="x" /> close icon to cancel.

   To remove a filter from the **Add label filter** field, click the
   <Icon icon="" /> close icon on the chip that represents the
   filter.

#### Labels and annotations

<Warning>
Changes you make to your SLO's **Labels** can also unexpectedly change its SLI's
definition, which causes an [error budget reset](#avoid-unintentional-budget-resets).
An unintentional budget reset can destructively change how your SLO represents the
service's performance against its objective.

Ensure that a budget reset is an acceptable outcome **before** you change this field
in an existing SLO.
</Warning>

Add **Labels and annotations** to provide context for the SLO.

- **SLO labels**: Add labels to this SLO for use in searches or
  [pinned scopes](/navigate/pinned-scopes).
- **Annotations**: Key/value pairs that
  [add information](/observe/services/service-pages#annotations) about the SLO.

### SLO preview

Use the **SLO preview** drawer to ensure the SLO definition meets your
specifications. The charts within the preview drawer are the same as those displayed
on the SLO's page after you create or update the SLO. Observability Platform
regenerates these preview charts as you modify fields in the **SLO Definition**
drawer.

As you iterate on your SLO's design, consult these tabs to confirm that the results
align with your expectations.

- The **SLI** tab charts **Total requests** and **Errors** over the selected time range.
- The **SLO** tab charts service availability over the selected time range.

  Toggle **Simulate alerts** to test your conditions against existing data. The
  chart displays any alerts that would have fired, and the preview reflects the
  SLO's signal grouping, dimensions, and burn rate configuration.

  Use the **Show alert durations** toggle to display the time range over which the
  alert would have been active.

  When you make changes to the SLO, click the **<Icon icon="arrows-rotate" /> refresh
  button in the time range selector to run the alerts simulation again.

The preview drawer also indicates the number of new time series that Observability
Platform will generate when you save the SLO. It also links to the
[Telemetry Usage Analyzer](/investigate/analyze/telemetry-analyzer) for further
analysis of the SLO's expected usage impact.

   endpoint of the Config API with the SLO's `slug`.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Avoid unintentional budget resets

Changes you make to your SLO's definition can also unexpectedly change its SLI's
definition, which resets your SLO's error budget. These unintentional _budget resets_
can destructively change how your SLO represents the service's performance against
its goal.

Changes to these fields cause budget resets:

- **Name**
- **Queries**
- **Dimensions**
- **Signals**
- **Additional filters** (label filters)
- **SLO labels**

When you change the values of these fields, you also change the data emitted from
your SLO, which in turn changes how your SLI calculates your error budgets for the
SLO's time window. This results in two sets of budgets, one from before the change
and one after the change, being displayed until a full time window has elapsed.

Ensure that a budget reset is an acceptable outcome **before** you change these
fields in an existing SLO.

When changing **Queries** or **Additional filters**, you might also change the number
of budgets being tracked. This could cause new budgets to appear or old budgets
to stop being updated, depending on the change you make.

## Configure SLOs with code

Changes you make in the **Visual Editor** of the **Create SLO** or **SLO Definition**
drawer are immediately reflected in the **Code Config** tab, which displays the SLO's
representation in code as either a **Terraform** resource, a **Chronoctl** YAML
definition, or a JSON object compatible with the Chronosphere **API**.

You can use the **Visual Editor** to define changes to an SLO and then **Copy**
or **Download** its code representation from the **Code Config** to apply it through
these other configuration tools. If an SLO is managed by Terraform, you can modify
it only by modifying its Terraform resource.

For details about Observability Platform's configuration as code features, see
[Use a GitOps workflow](/tooling/gitops).
