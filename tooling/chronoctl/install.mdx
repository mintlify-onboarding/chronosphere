To use Chronoctl, you must first [install](#download-and-install-chronoctl) the app
locally, and then [authenticate](#authentication) Chronoctl to your Chronosphere
Observability Platform instance.

## Download and install Chronoctl

Select from the following methods to download and install the latest version of
Chronoctl, based on your operating system.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS" id="installation-macos">

To download and install Chronoctl:

1. Use the [`curl`](https://curl.se) command to download Chronoctl for your system's
   architecture:

   - For Intel (64-bit x86) systems, run:

     ```shell
     curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/chronosphere-release/latest/chronoctl-darwin-amd64
     ```
   - For Apple Silicon (M-series) systems, run:

     ```shell
     curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/chronosphere-release/latest/chronoctl-darwin-arm64
     ```

   The remaining steps are based on the use of the `arm64` version. Replace `arm64`
   with `amd64` if you downloaded the Intel version of Chronoctl.
1. Make the Chronoctl binary executable:

   ```shell
   chmod +x chronoctl-darwin-arm64
   ```

1. Move the binary into your `PATH`:

   ```shell
   mv chronoctl-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/chronoctl
   ```

   If `chronoctl` is already installed, this overwrites it with the new version.
1. Ensure Chronoctl is successfully installed:

   ```shell
   chronoctl version
   ```

Chronosphere supports Chronoctl versions for one year from their release dates.
Use only a supported version unless explicitly instructed otherwise by Chronosphere
Support. If you experience issues, upgrade to the latest supported version by following
the installation steps again.

### Download and install a v0.x.x version

Chronoctl versions prior to v1.0.0 implement some deprecated features removed in
Chronoctl v1.0.0, such as:

- The [`sync prometheus` command](/tooling/chronoctl#sync-commands)
- The `convert` commands
- YAML definitions that use `kind: v2`

Chronosphere doesn't support the use of Chronoctl v0.x.x. The command syntax, features,
and data formats this older version of Chronoctl uses differ significantly from v1.0.0.
Use the v0.x.x version only if you must use these removed features, and only for
as long as required.

Select from the following methods to download and install Chronoctl v0.x.x, based
on your operating system.

## Authentication

Before you can use Chronoctl, you need both an API token and your organization's
name.

### API token

Chronoctl performs tasks that require administrative privileges, and requires an
API token with administrative privileges to authenticate. How you use Chronoctl
impacts the authentication mechanism for interacting with Observability Platform.
You can use Chronoctl for [local development](#local-development),
[local administration](#local-administration), and
[production environments](#production-environments).

Chronoctl accepts an API token as the `--api-token` argument, or as the contents
of a file specified as the argument of the `--api-token-filename` flag.

If you don't provide a token as an argument, Chronoctl then looks for it in the
environment variable `CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN`, which you can set by running the
following command or adding it to your shell profile:

```shell
export CHRONOSPHERE_API_TOKEN=TOKEN
```

Replace _`TOKEN`_ with the API token you generated to authenticate with Observability
Platform.

#### Local development

When using Chronoctl for local development, use [`chronoctl auth`](/tooling/chronoctl#auth) to
authenticate as your Observability Platform user.

You can use `chronoctl auth print-session-id` as the `API-Token` with any of the
[Chronosphere API endpoints](/tooling/api-info) when developing or testing locally.

#### Local administration

To authenticate as an administrative user account for local administration, use a
[personal access token](/administer/accounts-teams/personal-access-tokens).

#### Production environments

If you use Chronoctl in production environments as part of your continuous
integration, or in scripts, use
[service accounts](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts) to authenticate with
Observability Platform. Chronosphere recommends using either an unrestricted service
account, or a user or service account that belongs to a team with the SysAdmin role.

### Organization name

Chronoctl needs the name of your team's organization as the `--org-name` argument.
If you don't provide your organization's name as an argument, Chronoctl looks for
it in the environment variable `CHRONOSPHERE_ORG_NAME`.

To set this variable, run the following command or adding it to your shell profile:

```shell
export CHRONOSPHERE_ORG_NAME=NAME
```

Replace _`NAME`_ with the subdomain name you use to access Observability Platform.
For example, if your team uses `example.chronosphere.io`, your team's organization
name is `example`.

To use Chronoctl after installing it, see the [Overview](/tooling/chronoctl).
