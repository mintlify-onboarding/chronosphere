After you've [installed a Core Operator](/pipeline-install/install-operator) in
your Kubernetes cluster or Linux environment, you'll need to create a
[Core Instance](/pipelines/concepts#core-instance) in that
environment before deploying any pipelines.

<Note>
If you used Pipeline CLI to install your Core Operator in a Kubernetes cluster,
use Pipeline CLI to create a Core Instance. If you used Helm to install your
Core Operator in a Kubernetes cluster, use Helm to create a Core Instance.

If you installed your Core Operator in a Linux environment, use Pipeline CLI
to create a Core Instance.

1. If you're creating a Core Instance in a Linux environment, set your
   [Linux environment variables](/pipeline-install/environment-variables).

1. Run the following command to create a new Core Instance:

   ```shell
   calyptia create core_instance operator --name INSTANCE
   ```

   Replace _`INSTANCE`_ with the name you'd like to give your new Core Instance.

   To create your Core Instance in a specific [namespace](/pipeline-configure/kubernetes/namespaces),
   add the `--kube-namespace NAMESPACE` flag, and replace _`NAMESPACE`_ with the
   namespace where you want to create the Core Instance.

   If you're using custom certificates or your own certificate authority, add the
   `--no-tls-verify` flag.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Helm" id="create-helm">

```shell /INSTANCE/ /TOKEN/
helm install core-instance calyptia/core-instance --set coreInstance=INSTANCE --set cloudToken=TOKEN
```

Replace the following values:

- _`INSTANCE`_: The name for your new Core Instance.
- _`TOKEN`_: [Your API token](/pipeline-cli/authenticate) to authenticate with
   the Telemetry Pipeline backend.

</Tab>

## Next steps

After you've created a Core Instance, you can [configure](/pipeline-configure)
its behavior and begin to [create telemetry pipelines](/pipeline-data/create-modify).
Additionally, you can view and manage your Core Instances in the
[Telemetry Pipeline web interface](https://core.calyptia.com/).
