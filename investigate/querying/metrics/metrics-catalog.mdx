Chronosphere Observability Platform's [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer)
helps you search for existing metrics. To view all metrics in your tenant, find
specific metrics, and add or view details about them, use the Metrics Catalog.

To access the Metrics Catalog, in the navigation menu, click
**<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers**
<span aria-label="and then">></span> **Metrics Catalog**.

## Catalog information

Metrics in the catalog include the following information:

- **Metric name**: The metric's name.
- **Type**: The metric's [type](/control/shaping/types).
- **Labels**: The metric's [labels](#view-a-metrics-labels).
- **Description**: A [description](#edit-the-metric-description) of the metric.

Click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots menu in the metric's
row, or hover over the metric's row, to perform one of the following tasks:

- **View details**: Opens a drawer with the metric **Type**, **Description**, and
  a time series graph showing this metric's activity over the selected time period.
  Use the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three dots menu on the graph to perform
  actions similar to [panel options](/observe/dashboards/panels#common-panel-elements).
- **Open in Usage Analyzer**: Opens the [Telemetry Usage Analyzer](/investigate/analyze/usage)
  with this metric.
- **<Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" /> Open in Metrics Explorer**: Opens the Metrics Explorer
  with a query using this metric.
- **<Icon icon="copy" /> Copy**: Copies the metric's name to the clipboard.

See [common panel elements](/observe/dashboards/panels#common-panel-elements) for an explanation of the
other available tools.

### Filter the catalog

Use the **Search metrics** box to find a metric by name. The list updates as you
enter text into the search field.

You can filter the list by prefix:

1. Click **Metrics that start with (anything)**. This is the default filter, and
   it displays all metrics.
1. Type a prefix, or select one or more prefixes from the list. Each item in the
   list displays the number of metrics that have that prefix. For example, `activity (8)`
   means there are eight metrics which use that prefix.

   To select only one item in the list and clear any other selections, hover the
   cursor over one of the list items and click **Only**.
1. To confirm your selection, click outside the list.

Your catalog updates to display the selected metrics.

### Edit the metric description

The **Description** field provides more information about a metric to help users
understand what the metric is for and how it's used.

To add or change a description:

1. Click the metric's row in the catalog to open the **Overview** tab in the metric's
   panel.
1. In the **Description** field, click **Edit**.
1. In the box, enter a new or edit the existing description.
1. Click **Save** when finished, or **Cancel** to keep the existing value.

#### AI-generated descriptions

<LimitedAvail />

Observability Platform suggests AI-generated metric descriptions on metrics that
lack authored descriptions. These suggestions are designated as
**<Icon icon="palette" /> Generated by AI**.

To accept an AI-generated description, click **Accept**. To edit the generated description,
click **Edit**.

### View a preview visualization of the metric

The panel for each metric in the catalog includes a
[time series chart](/observe/dashboards/panels/time-series-chart) that visualizes
the metric over a recent time span, and a [time range selector](/navigate/time-ranges)
to select or pin a time span.

Click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> three vertical dots menu in the chart
to access additional tools:

- **<Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" /> Open in Metrics Explorer**: Opens the Metrics Explorer
  with a query using this metric.
- **Copy as image:** Copies an image of the chart's current view to your clipboard.
- **Export as PNG:** Downloads the chart's current view as a PNG image.
- **Add to dashboard:** Opens the [**Add panel to dashboard**](/observe/dashboards/customization/layouts#add-a-panel-group-to-a-dashboard)
   dialog.
- **Analyze anomaly (DDx):** Opens the
  [Differential Diagnosis](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/metrics)
  tool with a query using this metric.

### View a metric's labels

Click the **View labels** button to open the **Labels** tab of the metric's panel.
The table in this tab provides the following information about your metric's labels:

- **Label**: The label name associated with the metric. To copy the label name,
  hover the cursor over the label's row and click the <Icon path={{mdiContentCopy}} />
  copy icon.
- **Cardinality**: The number of unique values associated with the label.
- **Values**: The label values. Click **Show all** to expand the list to display
  additional values, if any. Click a label value to filter the results to the label
  and value pair.
  
  The table truncates long lists of values, and the table row indicates this by
  displaying the number of hidden values. To view all values, click **Show all**.
