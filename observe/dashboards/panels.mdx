_Panels_ allow you to visualize, filter, and transform the results of a query.
[Standard dashboards](/observe/dashboards) provide visualizations designed to work
with other Chronosphere Observability Platform features, such as Metrics Explorer.

Panels react to the time range set for a dashboard, and can be dynamically customized
by using [dashboard variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables).

## Common panel elements

All panels consist of common settings and features. You can add these during
panel creation, or edit them at a later time.

- **Name**: The panel's configured name.
- **Group**: The panel group that contains the panel.
- **Description**: A description of the panel displayed when holding the pointer over
  an Information icon.
- **Type**: A panel's [_type_](#panel-types) defines its visualization method or
  content. By default, new panels are the
  [Time Series Chart](/observe/dashboards/panels/time-series-chart) type.
- **<Icon icon="link" alt="Link icon"/> Links**: An icon that reveals any links
  configured for the panel.
- **<Icon icon="expand" alt="Expand arrow icon"/> Expand**: Expands the
  panel to a the full width and height of the browser for a more detailed view.
- **<Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" alt="Options icon"/> Options**: Opens a menu
  of panel-related actions, depending on the panel type.
  - **Edit panel**: Used to update the panel.
  - **Open in Metrics Explorer**: Click to open a new tab using the panel's queries
    in [Metrics Explorer](/investigate/querying/metrics/explorer). When opening
    Metrics Explorer from this link, **Resolution** settings carry over.
  - **Copy as link**: Copy a link directly to this panel. When used, the link
    opens the panel in full-screen mode.
  - **Copy as image**: Copy the panel as an image to the operating system clipboard.
  - **Export as PNG**: Download the panel as a PNG file. The filename matches the
    panel name.
  - **Add to dashboard**: Copy this panel to another dashboard. Select an existing
    dashboard or create a new one.
  - **Analyze anomaly (DDx)**: On time series panels, use this link to open the
    [metrics differential diagnosis](/investigate/analyze/differential-diagnosis/metrics)
    page with the panel's query.
  - **Inspect panel**: Review statistics about the panel's query or queries.

Panels can also have additional options presented in tabs of the **Edit panel** interface.
Most panels provide these tabs:

- **Query**: Observability Platform uses results from
  [queries](#change-a-panels-query) to populate the panel's visualization.
- **Settings**: Configuration options for the selected panel type.
- **Links**: [Links](#add-links-to-a-panel) associated with the panel, which can
  optionally use variables provided by Observability Platform related to the panel or
  dashboard.
- **JSON**: An editable, automatically updated
  [JSON representation](/observe/dashboards/panels/json-representation) of the panel's
  configuration.

## Create panels in a dashboard

To add and use panels in a dashboard, you must first
[create a dashboard](/observe/dashboards#create-a-dashboard) or select an existing
dashboard to which you'll add the panel.

Each panel in a dashboard belongs to a
[_panel group_](/observe/dashboards/customization/layouts#add-a-panel-group-to-a-dashboard),
which is a container of one or more panels.
If a dashboard doesn't have any panel groups, Observability Platform creates one
for you when you add a panel.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="add-panels-to-a-dashboard-cloud">

To add a panel to a standard dashboard with no existing panel groups:

1. Open the dashboard. You can
   [view a list of all dashboards](/observe/dashboards#view-dashboards) or select
   from a [list of dashboards in a collection](/administer/collections/home).
1. Click **<Icon icon="pencil" alt="Edit icon"/> Edit** on the dashboard.
1. Click **<Icon icon="chart-simple-plus" alt="Panel icon"/> Panel**.
1. In the **Add Panel** interface that appears, provide a **Name** for the new panel.
1. Optional: Configure the panel based on the [panel options](#common-panel-elements) and
   [panel type](#panel-types) you want to use.
1. Click **Add** to add the panel or **Cancel** to discard it.

To add a new panel to a panel group:

1. In the panel group to which you want to add a panel, click the
   **<Icon icon="chart-simple-plus" alt="Add panel to group icon"/> Add panel to group**
   icon.
1. In the **Add Panel** interface that appears, provide a **Name** for the new panel.
1. Click **Add** to add the panel or **Cancel** to discard it.

Panels aren't permanently added to a dashboard until you save all changes to
the dashboard by clicking **Save** on the dashboard.

You can save a new panel to a dashboard with as little as a name, then edit
it later to configure it and add or modify queries.

### Panel types

For details about these settings or unique features in a panel type, see its
documentation. The panel types available for visualizing data include:

- [**Time Series Chart**](/observe/dashboards/panels/time-series-chart): A line
or bar chart representation of time series data returned by the panel's queries.
- [**Bar Chart**](/observe/dashboards/panels/bar-chart): A bar chart representation
  of data returned by the panel's queries.
- [**Heat Map**](/observe/dashboards/panels/heat-map): The density of data points
  across ranges of values returned by a query, visualized by colors that represent
  the magnitude of data for each range of values.
- [**Stat Chart**](/observe/dashboards/panels/stat-chart): A stat chart visualizes
  statistic numbers returned by a query.
- [**Gauge Chart**](/observe/dashboards/panels/gauge-chart): A value for each data
  point returned by a query, visualized as a configurable gauge depicting a minimum
  and maximum range and configurable thresholds.
- [**Markdown**](/observe/dashboards/panels/markdown): Renders defined Markdown
  text.
- [**Table**](/observe/dashboards/panels/markdown): Presents the data returned by
  the query as a customizable table.
- [**Pie Chart**](/observe/dashboards/panels/pie-chart): A pie chart representation
  of data returned by the panel's queries.
- [**Distribution Chart**](/observe/dashboards/panels/distribution-chart): A
  visualization of histograms by bucket.
- [**Service Topology**](/observe/dashboards/panels/service-topology): View trace
  data related to this dashboard.

## View panel information

The **Inspect panel** drawer presents information about your panel. Panel inspection
isn't valid for Markdown or Service Topology panels.

### Overview

The **Overview** tab displays statistics about the performance of your query or queries.
Overview details vary depending on the [panel type](#panel-types). All panels have
the following options:

- **Number of queries**: How many queries the panel uses to generate the
  visualization.
- **Query type**: The type of query, which is related to the panel type.
- **Longest request duration**: The longest response time for a query request.

Time series charts have these additional statistics:

- **Interval step size**: The query [interval size](/observe/dashboards/customization/intervals).
- **Number of series**: The number of time series returned.
- **Max data points per series**: The maximum number of data points returned per series.
- **Total number of data points**: Number of data points returned by the query.

Table charts have these additional statistics:

- **Number of table rows**: For table charts, the number of rows in the table.
- **Number of table columns**: For table charts, the number of columns in the table.

Bar, stat, gauge, pie, and distribution charts have this additional statistic:

- **Number of series (single value)**: The number of series returned.

### Queries

The **Queries** tab displays details for each query used to generate the panel. Each
query has its own informational box, such as **Query 1** and **Query 2**. Each query
has the following entries:

- **Query**: The query you entered, including any
  [variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables) used.
- **Raw Query**: The actual query used to retrieve data, which translates variables
  into real values.

## Edit a panel

You can customize the features of each panel in a dashboard and edit the queries
used to populate it.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="edit-panels-on-a-dashboard-cloud">

To edit a panel in a standard dashboard:

1. Open the dashboard. You can
   [view a list of all dashboards](/observe/dashboards#view-dashboards) or select
   from a [list of dashboards in a collection](/administer/collections/home).
1. Click **Edit** for the dashboard.
1. Click **Edit** for the panel you want to edit.
1. In the **Edit panel** interface that appears, configure the panel based on the
   [panel options](#common-panel-elements) and [panel type](#panel-types) you want to
   use.
1. Click **Apply** to apply the changes or **Cancel** to discard them.

After you've finished editing panels, click **Save** on the dashboard to save your
changes.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl">

<ChronoctlDashboard />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Change a panel's type

You can change the type of panel at any time.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="change-a-panels-type-cloud">

To change a panel's type:

1. Open the panel's editor.
1. Click the **Type** dropdown.
1. Select a panel type.
1. Click **Apply** to save any panel type changes and exit the panel editor.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chronoctl">

<ChronoctlDashboard />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Change a panel's query

Queries populate panels with data to visualize. Use one of the following methods
to create a query:

- In the **Code** tab, write your own query or paste a known query.
- Use the **Builder** tab to create a query using the
  [query builder](/investigate/querying/metrics/query-builder).

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web" id="change-a-panels-query-cloud">

You can change the query a panel uses when the data doesn't match your needs.

1. Open the panel's editor.
1. Select the **Query** tab.
1. Optional:
    - Change the **Resolution** of a query. This setting controls the maximum
      data points per series. Options are:
      - **Low**: Prioritizes query performance over accuracy.
      - **Medium**: (Default) Balances performance and accuracy.
      - **High**: Uses more data points to provide more precise results, but might have
        degraded performance.
      - **Custom**: Set a custom step size. If you select **Custom**, you must enter a
        **Custom resolution** with [time units](/overview/concepts/time-units). For
        example, `30m`. This field supports duration
        [variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables). For more
        details, see [Dashboard query interval and resolution](/observe/dashboards/customization/intervals).
      - Change the **Time preference**:
        - Toggle **Use dashboard time**.
        - Add a **Relative time override**. You can use custom variables in the
          override if they're duration-based.
1. Select a **Datasource** for the query. This selection determines the syntax you
   can enter. For example, selecting **Metrics (Prometheus)** accepts
   [PromQL syntax](/investigate/querying/promql), whereas selecting **Logs** accepts
   [Chronosphere log syntax](/investigate/querying/query-logs/query-syntax).
1. Enter expressions for the query you want to edit.

   The visualization preview changes as you edit the query. If the query doesn't
   return any data, the visualization preview doesn't indicate any changes. If the
   query or results return an error, an icon appears next to the panel name.
1. Optional: Add a **Series alias** to define the name displayed for the series
   in the panel's tooltip and legend.

    <Info>
    If you select a **Logs** query that includes a field which contains a period (`.`)
      in its name (such as `k8s.namespace`), and you want to use signals to group
      notifications, use an
      [alias for that field name](/investigate/querying/query-logs/query-syntax#alias-field-names).
      Otherwise, periods are converted to underscores in the generated visualization.
    </Info>

1. Optional: Change the **Resolution** of a query. This setting controls the maximum
   data points per series. Options are:
   - **Low**: Prioritizes query performance over accuracy.
   - **Medium**: (Default) Balances performance and accuracy.
   - **High**: Uses more data points to provide more precise results, but might have
     degraded performance.
   - **Custom**: Set a custom step size. If you select **Custom**, you must enter a
     **Custom resolution** with [time units](/overview/concepts/time-units). For
     example, `30m`. This field supports duration
     [variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables).

     Lower resolutions will return results faster, but can reduce data spikes due to
     [downsampling](/control/shaping/downsampling). If you find
     you're missing spikes at **Low** resolution, changing to **High** resolution
     or using an aggregation function like `max_over_time` can help. See
     [Disappearing spikes when increasing the range​](https://chronosphere.io/learn/understanding-promql-and-its-quirks/#Disappearing%20spikes%20when%20increasing%20the%20range%E2%80%8B)
     in the Chronosphere blog for a detailed explanation.
1. Optional: Add additional queries by clicking **Add query**.
1. Optional: Hide a visualized query by clicking **Hide query**, or show a hidden
   query by clicking **Show query**.
1. Change a query's **Options** based on the [panel type](#panel-types).
1. Click **Apply** to save any query changes and exit the panel editor.

For details about writing queries, read the [querying documentation](/investigate/querying).

You can use [dashboard variables](/observe/dashboards/customization/dashboard-variables)
in a query to let dashboard users dynamically customize them without modifying
the query itself.

If you include a dashboard variable that doesn't exist, Observability Platform notifies
you of the missing variable in the query editor and includes a link of the variable
name that automatically creates and configures the suggested variable.
