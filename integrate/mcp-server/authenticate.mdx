Before you can use the Chronosphere Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, you need to
authenticate with the MCP client you use to access a large language model (LLM). Use
one of the following options to configure authentication:

- Generate a Chronosphere API token, either through a personal access token or a
  service account.
- Use [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/). To use the Chronosphere MCP server with OAuth,
  your MCP client must support OAuth.

  <Info>
  OAuth authentication with the Chronosphere MCP server has been tested with the
    following MCP clients only.
  </Info>

The following steps explain how to authenticate with popular AI-powered code editors.
After authenticating, you can use the LLM features in your code editor to interact
with the [Chronosphere MCP server tools](/integrate/mcp-server/resources).

## Prerequisites

If you're authenticating your MCP client with a Chronosphere API token, use one of
the following options to generate one:

- **Personal access**: Create a
  [personal access token](/administer/accounts-teams/personal-access-tokens) to
  authenticate your user account with Chronosphere. When you authenticate with a
  personal access token, Chronosphere Observability Platform associates the actions
  you take with your identity and respects the permissions granted to your user
  account's team.
- **Programmatic access**: Create an
  [unrestricted service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts#create-an-unrestricted-service-account)
  to create a persistent identity for a service or agent that you want to authenticate
  with your MCP client. You must have
  [administrative access](/administer/accounts-teams/user-accounts#grant-system-administrator-sysadmin-privileges-to-users)
  to create a service account.

## Authenticating using Claude Code

To authenticate with the Chronosphere MCP server from Claude Code, add the MCP server
as a
[remote HTTP server](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#option-3%3A-add-a-remote-http-server).

1. From within Claude Code, run the following command:

   ```bash /TENANT/ /API_TOKEN/
   claude mcp add --transport http chronosphere "https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/api/mcp/mcp" \
   --header "Authorization: API_TOKEN"
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`TENANT`_: The name of your Observability Platform tenant.
   - _`API_TOKEN`_: The API token generated from your service account. Chronosphere
     recommends storing your API token in a separate file or Kubernetes Secret and
     calling it using an environment variable, such as `$API_TOKEN`.

    <Info>
    To authenticate using OAuth instead of a Chronosphere API token, omit the
      `--header` flag. You can also use the `/mcp` command to authenticate with OAuth
      authentication.
    </Info>

1. Test your connection with the Chronosphere MCP server:

   ```bash
   claude mcp get chronosphere
   ```

The command returns the details for the Chronosphere MCP server.

## Authenticating using Cursor

To authenticate with the Chronosphere MCP server from Cursor, modify the `mcp.json`
file to include the Chronosphere MCP server remote endpoint.

1. From within Cursor,
   [access the `mcp.json` file](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp#using-mcpjson).
1. Add the following configuration to the `mcp.json` file:

   ```json /TENANT/ /API_TOKEN/
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "chronosphere": {
         "url": "https://TENANT.chronosphere.io/api/mcp/mcp",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer API_TOKEN"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`TENANT`_: The name of your Observability Platform tenant.
   - _`API_TOKEN`_: The API token generated from your service account. Chronosphere
     recommends storing your API token in a separate file or Kubernetes Secret and
     calling it using an environment variable, such as `$API_TOKEN`.

    <Info>
    To authenticate using OAuth instead of a Chronosphere API token, omit the
      `headers` section from the configuration.
    </Info>

1. Save and close the `mcp.json` file.
1. Refresh the MCP server settings in Cursor.

The Chronosphere MCP server displays in the list of configured MCP servers.
