## Get going

To get started with Observability Platform, [authenticate](overview/authenticating) and sign in. You can then take many actions, but likely want to start with one of these:

* Locate [dashboards](/observe) that matter to your team.
* Investigate [monitors](/investigate/alerts) and configure alerts.
* Write [queries](/investigate/querying) to search for pertinent data.
* Explore [services](/observe/services) you care about.

## Send data

Before you observe anything, you need to send your data to Observability Platform. Instrumentation engineers can use one of the supported collection methods to ingest telemetry data.

## Authenticate

To start using Observability Platform, sign in with your user account to authenticate. Within Observability Platform, user and service accounts provide access to Chronosphere resources that help you observe and act on relevant data.

## Query data

After sending telemetry data to Observability Platform, you can query all of your data to help identify issues and determine which services are causing latency. This capability helps during incident response when you’re trying to identify the source of an issue.

## Control data

Take control of your telemetry data to keep costs predictable and manageable as your business scales, and helps teams manage their data effectively by reducing the amount of available information. When you optimize your telemetry data, on-call engineers can find the data they need to solve problems faster.

## Visualize data

Chronosphere Lens gives you visibility into the health and performance of your applications by ingesting metrics, traces, logs, and change events that you can observe using services and dashboards.

## Administrate

Administrative users focus on observability tools so that developers can use those tools to monitor and maintain the health of their distributed system. As an administrative user, you might focus on cost control, data collection, data usability, and platform usability.
