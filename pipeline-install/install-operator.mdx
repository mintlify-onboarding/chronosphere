title: Install a Core Operator
'og:description': Install a Core Operator to run Telemetry Pipeline in Kubernetes or Linux.

{/* -- dri: Alexa Kreizinger -- */}


As the first step of your Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline deployment, you must install a
[Core Operator](/pipelines/concepts#core-operators-and-core-instances). This installation process
differs between Kubernetes and Linux.

## Kubernetes

[Installing a Core Operator in a Kubernetes cluster](/pipeline-install/install-operator/kubernetes-cluster)
creates a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
within that cluster.

You'll need to install a Core Operator in each cluster where you'd like to use
Telemetry Pipeline. For example, if you have ten clusters, you must install ten
Core Operators.

## Linux

{/* vale Chronosphere.Units = NO */}

[Installing a Core Operator on Linux](/pipeline-install/install-operator/linux)
automatically deploys a K3s cluster in your Linux environment, then creates a Core
Operator within that cluster.

You'll need to install a Core Operator in each Linux environment where you'd
like to use Telemetry Pipeline. For example, if you have ten Linux virtual
machines, you must install ten Core Operators, and each of those Core Operators
will run within its own dedicated k3s cluster.
