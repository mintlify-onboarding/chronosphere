After [ingesting data](/ingest/logs), use Logs Explorer to verify that Chronosphere
Observability Platform is receiving log data.

1. In the navigation menu select
   **<Icon icon="compass" /> Explorers <span aria-label="and then">></span> Logs Explorer**.
1. On the **Logs Explorer** page, select a time window that includes the period when
   Observability Platform started ingesting log data.

   The timeline graph displays a spike at the time when Observability Platform
   started ingesting log data.

1. Verify the `message`, `timestamp`, `service`, and `severity` fields are being
   assigned correctly. If these fields aren't mapped in the way you intended, contact
   [Chronosphere Support](/support).
