To install and use the Chronosphere Collector, you define a manifest that describes
how the Collector operates. Manifests are static YAML files that include details such
as the installation method for the Collector and what endpoints the Collector scrapes
to ingest data.

You can base your manifest on
[this example](https://storage.googleapis.com/chronosphere-release/latest/kubernetes/chronocollector.yaml),
which contains details about common configuration options when installing the
Collector with Kubernetes to retrieve metric data.

You can modify the default Collector manifest to:

- [Apply recommended optimizations](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/configure/optimizations).
- [Monitor Kubernetes resources](/ingest/metrics-traces/collector/discover/monitor-kubernetes).

## Modify the Collector manifest

If you modify the Collector configuration manifest, you must send the updated
manifest to the cluster and then restart the Collector:

1. Apply the updated manifest to the cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f path/to/manifest.yml
   ```

1. Restart the Collector to propagate the changes:

   **DaemonSet**

   ```shell
   kubectl rollout restart daemonset/chronocollector
   ```

   **Deployment**

   ```shell
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/chronocollector
   ```
