Chronoctl is a Chronosphere-supplied app that lets you manage your organization's
Chronosphere Observability Platform resources from the command line.

For example, to list your team's monitor definitions:

```shell
chronoctl monitors list
```

<InfoTerraformLockout />

To view product release notes for Chronoctl you must sign in to Observability Platform.
In the navigation menu select
**<Icon icon="circle-info" /> More information <span aria-label="and then">></span> Release Notes**,
and then click the **Chronoctl** tab.

## Getting started

To install Chronoctl, see [Install Chronoctl](/tooling/chronoctl/install).

To use Chronoctl, you must provide an API token and organization name to
[authenticate](/tooling/chronoctl/install#authentication) as an account with `SysAdmin`
privileges. You can provide the token and organization name by either configuring
them as environment variables or passing them with the command. You can also securely
authenticate by using the [`chronoctl auth`](#auth) command.

After you're ready to use Chronoctl, refer to its [commands](#command-list) to
directly control your Observability Platform environment.

## Supported resources

Use Chronoctl commands to take actions on Observability Platform _resources_, such
as dashboards, teams, or collections. To display a list of the resources supported by
your installed version of Chronoctl, view the Chronoctl help:

```shell
chronoctl --help
```

The list of available resources displays in the **Chronosphere Configuration** section
of the output.

## Command list

Chronoctl is based on the structure of the Chronosphere API, which helps
its commands be as consistent with one another as possible. This also better reflects
features as they're presented for use in the Chronosphere API itself.

### Flags

Each command has several _flags_ for customizing its output or behavior.

In addition to the [authentication](/tooling/chronoctl/install#authentication) flags, flags
that are common among commands include:

- `-h`, `--help`: Outputs help text for the given command.
- `--timeout`: Defines a duration in seconds for the request before it times out
  and fails. Defaults to 30 seconds.

Chronoctl commands that return data representations of resources have additional
common flags:

- `-o`, `--output`: Defines the output format. Accepts `json` for JSON, `jsonl` for JSON
  Lines, or defaults to `yaml` for YAML.

Chronoctl commands that can change the state of a resource in Observability Platform,
such as `chronoctl apply` or resource `create` and `update` subcommands, also have:

- `-d`, `--dry-run`: If set, Chronoctl simulates but doesn't apply the manifest
  or change in a dry run, and then displays the predicted result.
- `--no-strict`: If set, Chronoctl accepts manifests or changes that contain unknown
  fields.

### Slugs

Observability Platform identifies each resource by a unique _slug_, which has a
255-character length limit and contains only letters, numbers, underscores (`_`),
and dashes (`-`). Slugs are case-sensitive. By default, Observability Platform generates
a random slug (containing less than 255 characters) for each resource. Chronoctl
lets you optionally specify a slug when creating resources.

### Configuration commands

Configuration commands are the recommended way to interact with Observability
Platform resources. Use the [`apply`](#apply) command for interacting with multiple
resources, but in most cases, uses the configuration commands.

Each of these commands are specific to Observability Platform resource types, which
have the same following subcommands:

- [`create`](#create)
- [`delete`](#delete)
- [`list`](#list)
- [`read`](#read)
- [`scaffold`](#scaffold)
- [`update`](#update)

#### `create`

Creates one resource of the given type. For example:

```shell /RESOURCE/ /FILE_NAME/
chronoctl RESOURCE create -f FILE_NAME.yaml
```

Replace the following:

- _`RESOURCE`_: The resource you want to take action on.
- _`FILE_NAME`_: The name of the definition file you want to use.

<Info>
To create resources that require SysAdmin access, such as teams and accounts, you
must use either of these processes:

- Authenticate as a user or service account that's a member of a team with
  SysAdmin access.
- Start a session using [`chronoctl auth`](#auth).
</Info>

For more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags,
see the Chronoctl command line help.

```shell /RESOURCE/
chronoctl RESOURCE create --help
```

Replace _`RESOURCE`_ with the resource you want to take action on.

#### `delete`

Deletes one resource of the given type. For example:

```shell /RESOURCE/ /SLUG/
chronoctl RESOURCE delete SLUG
```

Replace the following:

- _`RESOURCE`_: The resource you want to take action on.
- _`SLUG`_: The slug of the resource you want to delete.

<Info>
To delete resources that require SysAdmin access, such as teams and accounts, you
must use either of these processes:

- Authenticate as a user or service account that's a member of a team with
  SysAdmin access.
- Start a session using [`chronoctl auth`](#auth).
</Info>

For more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags,
see the Chronoctl command line help.

```shell /RESOURCE/
chronoctl RESOURCE delete --help
```

Replace _`RESOURCE`_ with the resource you want to take action on.

#### `list`

Lists all resources of the given type. For example:

```shell /RESOURCE/
chronoctl RESOURCE list
```

Replace _`RESOURCE`_ with the resource you want to take action on.

For more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags,
see the Chronoctl command line help.

```shell /RESOURCE/
chronoctl RESOURCE list --help
```

Replace _`RESOURCE`_ with the resource you want to take action on.

#### `read`

Outputs one resource of the given type. For example:

```shell /RESOURCE/ /SLUG/
chronoctl RESOURCE read SLUG
```

Replace the following:

- _`RESOURCE`_: The resource you want to take action on.
- _`SLUG`_: The slug of the resource you want to output.

For more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags,
see the Chronoctl command line help.

```shell /RESOURCE/
chronoctl RESOURCE read --help
```

Replace _`RESOURCE`_ with the resource you want to take action on.

#### `scaffold`

Outputs an example resource definition of the given type, including inline comments
documenting its properties. For example:

```shell /RESOURCE/
chronoctl RESOURCE scaffold
```

Replace _`RESOURCE`_ with the resource you want to take action on.

#### `update`

Updates a resource of the given type. For example:

```shell /RESOURCE/ /FILE_NAME/
chronoctl RESOURCE update -f FILE_NAME.yaml
```

Replace the following:

- _`RESOURCE`_: The resource you want to take action on.
- _`FILE_NAME`_: The name of the definition file you want to use.

<Info>
To update resources that require SysAdmin access, such as teams and accounts, you
must use either of these processes:

- Authenticate as a user or service account that's a member of a team with
  SysAdmin access.
- Start a session using [`chronoctl auth`](#auth).
</Info>

For more information about the subcommand, including its usage and accepted flags,
see the Chronoctl command line help.

```shell /RESOURCE/
chronoctl RESOURCE update --help
```

Replace _`RESOURCE`_ with the resource you want to take action on.

### Core commands

Chronoctl core commands are independent of any resource type.

#### `apply`

Applies a configuration change to resources from a YAML or JSON file, or from
standard input. When you apply resources with Chronoctl, Observability Platform
creates them if they don't already exist.

The `apply` command accepts input from a file by providing the path as the value
of the `-f` (`--filename`) flag.

For example, to apply a file containing a resource's YAML manifest:

```shell
chronoctl apply -f resources.yml
```

To apply a resource passed from standard input, use the `-` value of the `-f` flag:

```shell
chronoctl apply -f -
```

Upon success, the command returns the list of changes applied.

The `apply` command accepts the dry run (`-d`, `--dry-run`) flag, which displays
the changes without applying them.

```shell
chronoctl apply -f resources.yml -d
```

#### `auth`

> Requires Chronoctl version 1.8.0 or later (or Chronoctl 0.65.0 or later if you're
> using a version earlier than 1.0.0).

Handles secure programmatic access to Observability Platform. This command lets
users access their organizations' applications after
[authentication](/tooling/chronoctl/install#authentication) with Chronoctl.

<Info>
This command uses a `session_ID` rather than an API token.
</Info>

- `login`: Authenticate the Chronoctl session as your Observability Platform user.
- `logout`: Log the user out of their authenticated Chronoctl session. This command
   only revokes Chronoctl session IDs. Revoke service accounts using the
   [`DeleteServiceAccount`](/tooling/api-info/definition/operations/DeleteServiceAccount)
   API endpoint.
- `list`: List all authenticated Observability Platform organizations the current
  user can access. Users might have access to multiple organizations such as a
  production and a test organization.
- `print-session-id`: Print the stored session id for an Observability Platform
  organization.
- `set-default-org`: Sets the default Observability Platform organization for future
  commands.
- `whoami`: Use to return the name of an existing
  [service account](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts). Supply the
  argument `--api-token=TOKEN` where _`TOKEN`_ is a service account token.

To sign in, use this command:

```shell /YOUR-ORG-NAME/
chronoctl auth login --org-name YOUR-ORG-NAME
```

Replace _`YOUR-ORG-NAME`_ with the organization you want to sign in to. For example, if
your Observability Platform tenant is `https://acme.chronosphere.io`, replace
_`YOUR-ORG-NAME`_ with `acme`, and then follow the prompts.

This process generates a `session_ID`, which is cached on your machine and valid
for 24 hours. If a [personal access token](/administer/accounts-teams/personal-access-tokens) or
[service account token](/administer/accounts-teams/service-accounts) isn't passed to Chronoctl
using an environment variable or command line flag, Chronoctl uses the cached `session_ID`
to authenticate your command.

### State commands

These commands evaluate the current state of Observability Platform.

#### `rule-evaluations list`

The `list` subcommand is the only subcommand for `rule-evaluations`.

Returns a list of [rule evaluation failures](/control/shaping/rules/evaluation-failures),
including the rule's type, slug, failure count, message, and detection timestamp.

### Sync commands

The `sync` command accepts the `prometheus` subcommand only. Use the `sync prometheus`
command to sync a Prometheus rules YAML file and a Prometheus Alertmanager YAML
configuration file into Chronosphere format.

You include a `chronoconfig.yaml` file to assign the rules to a team, and to specify
a team to own the related notification policy. This command converts and applies the
assets and resources to your tenant.

<Warning>
The `sync prometheus` command is supported only in Chronoctl v0.x.x versions. You can
[download and install](/tooling/chronoctl/install#download-and-install-a-v0xx-version) a
v0.x.x version if you require this command. However, Chronosphere doesn't support
continued use of Chronoctl v0.x.x.
</Warning>

```shell
chronoctl sync prometheus
```

To sync Prometheus rules into Chronosphere format:

1. Define a `chronoconfig.yaml` file to assign the converted rules to a team, and
   specify a team to own the related notification policy:

   ```yaml /OWNER_TEAM/ /POLICY_TEAM/
   use_collections: "TRUE"
   group_teams:
     - group_regex: ".*"
       team_slug: "OWNER_TEAM"
   notification_policy_team_slug: "POLICY_TEAM"
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`OWNER_TEAM`_: The `slug` of the Observability Platform team to own the
     converted rules.
   - _`POLICY_TEAM`_: The `slug` of the Observability Platform team to own the
     notification policy.

1. Run the `sync prometheus` command and pass in your Prometheus rules file,
   Prometheus Alertmanager configuration file, and `chronoconfig.yaml` file:

   ```shell /ALERTMANAGER_CONFIG/ /PROM_RULES/ /FLAGS/
   chronoctl sync prometheus -a [ALERTMANAGER_CONFIG] -p [PROM_RULES] -c chronoconfig.yaml [FLAGS]
   ```

   Replace the following:

   - _`ALERTMANAGER_CONFIG`_: The file containing your Prometheus Alertmanager
     configuration.
   - _`PROM_RULES`_: The file containing your Prometheus rules.
   - _`FLAGS`_: Any flags to include with the command. Run
     `chronoctl sync prometheus --help` to display supported flags.

### Additional commands

These commands provide additional information as you use Chronoctl.

#### `help`

Displays help text for the tool and any specified subcommand.

```shell
chronoctl help
```

#### `version`

Displays the version, revision, build date, and Go version for Chronoctl. Provide
this information when reporting an issue with Chronoctl to Chronosphere Support.

```shell
chronoctl version
```

## Command autocompletion

You can add support for shell command autocompletion with Chronoctl for the Bash,
Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell by using the `chronoctl completion` command.

This section provides detailed steps for Bash and Zsh on macOS. For Linux-specific
details and instructions for Fish and PowerShell, see the output of
`chronoctl help completion`.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Bash" id="autocomplete-bash">

1. Update or install `bash-completion`:

   ```shell
   brew install bash-completion
   ```

1. In a shell initialization script, such as `~/.bashrc`, add the following:

   ```shell
   source "$(brew --prefix bash-completion)/etc/bash_completion"
   eval "$(chronoctl completion bash)"
   ```

1. Restart the shell.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Zsh" id="autocomplete-zsh">

1. Go to your Zsh `site-functions` folder.

   - If you installed Zsh with Homebrew, the path is
     `/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions`.
   - If you use the default macOS Zsh, the path is
     `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions`.

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   chronoctl completion zsh > _chronoctl
   ```

1. Ensure your `~/.zshrc` file has
   [`compinit`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html) added.
   If you use `oh-my-zsh`, it adds that for you.

1. Restart the shell.
