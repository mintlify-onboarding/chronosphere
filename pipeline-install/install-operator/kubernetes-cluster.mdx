To get started with Chronosphere Telemetry Pipeline on Kubernetes, you'll need to
install a [Core Operator](/pipelines/concepts#core-operator)
in each Kubernetes cluster where you want to deploy pipelines.

## Supported Kubernetes distributions

Telemetry Pipeline is compatible with the following distributions of Kubernetes:

- Open Source Kubernetes 1.25 or later
- Amazon Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Red Hat Open Shift 4.0 or later

## Installation steps

You can use [Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli) or Helm to install a Core Operator in
a Kubernetes cluster.

<Info>
When you install a Core Operator, only deploy a single replica.
If a Core Operator has multiple replicas, those replicas will conflict with one another.

<Tab title="Pipeline CLI" id="install-cli">

1. [Review the Telemetry Pipeline installation prerequisites](/pipeline-install/prereqs).

1. [Install](/pipeline-cli/install) or [update](/pipeline-cli/install#update-pipeline-cli)
   Pipeline CLI. Because Core Operator versions are dependent on your Pipeline CLI
   version, keeping Pipeline CLI current ensures that you're installing
   the latest version of Core Operator.

1. If you haven't already, [set an API token in Pipeline CLI](/pipeline-cli/authenticate).

1. Ensure that the
   [`KUBECONFIG`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
   environment variable in your cluster is set to a valid configuration file.

1. Run the following command to install a Core Operator:

   ```shell
   calyptia install operator
   ```

   Optionally, you can add the `--kube-namespace` command to set that Core
   Operator's [namespace](/pipeline-configure/kubernetes/namespaces).

1. Repeat these steps for each Kubernetes cluster where you want to use Telemetry
   Pipeline.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Helm" id="install-helm">

1. [Review the Telemetry Pipeline installation prerequisites](/pipeline-install/prereqs).

1. Ensure that [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is installed and has a valid connection
   to your target cluster.

1. Ensure that the
   [`KUBECONFIG`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
   environment variable in your cluster is set to a valid configuration file.

1. Run the following command to add the Telemetry Pipeline chart repository:

   ```shell
   helm repo add calyptia https://helm.calyptia.com/
   ```

1. Run the following command to install the custom resource definitions (CRDs)
   that Telemetry Pipeline relies on:

   ```shell
   helm install core-crd calyptia/core-crd
   ```

    To optionally set a custom registry for your Core Operator, add the flag
   `--set global.imageRegistry='NAME'` to this command. Replace _`NAME`_ with
   the name of your custom registry.

1. Run the following command to install Core Operator:

   ```shell
   helm install core-operator calyptia/core-operator
   ```

1. Repeat these steps for each Kubernetes cluster where you want to use Telemetry
   Pipeline.

## View installation logs

After you install a Core Operator in a Kubernetes cluster, use the
following kubectl command to view logs from the installation process:

```shell
kubectl logs deploy/calyptia-core-controller-manager
```

## Next steps

After you've installed a Core Operator in your Linux environment, you can
[create a Core Instance](/pipeline-install/create-instance) in that environment.
